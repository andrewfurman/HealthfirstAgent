# Audio Output Issue - Debugging Documentation

## Issue Description
**Date:** August 1, 2025  
**Problem:** OpenAI Realtime API voice chat audio output is not working. The user can speak to the AI assistant (input works), and the transcript displays correctly, but no audio output is heard from the AI assistant's responses.

## Symptoms
1. **Microphone input works** - The AI can hear the user
2. **Transcript displays correctly** - Text responses from AI appear in the UI
3. **No audio output** - User cannot hear the AI's voice responses
4. **Browser console shows:** `Track muted: true` for the incoming audio track from OpenAI
5. **Audio element shows time progressing** (e.g., 0:20) but no sound is heard
6. **Issue persists across multiple code versions** - Even reverting to earlier commits doesn't fix it

## System Information
- **Platform:** macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- **Browser:** Unknown (user didn't specify, but issue persists)
- **Server:** Flask development server on port 8080
- **API:** OpenAI Realtime API with model `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`
- **Python:** 3.9 with venv
- **Key Libraries:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, requests

## Timeline of Events

### Working State (Earlier in the day)
- Voice chat was reportedly working before attempts to add tool call display features
- Configuration had tools/functions configured for querying health plan data
- Instructions were included for the call center agent persona

### When Issue Started
- Issue began around 22:10 (10:10 PM) on August 1, 2025
- Started after attempting to add tool call notification display feature
- Initial request was to show tool calls in the transcript with plain English descriptions

## Debugging Attempts (In Chronological Order)

### 1. Initial Tool Call Display Implementation
**What was changed:**
- Added `displayToolCall()` function in `print_transcript.js`
- Updated `script.js` to detect `response.function_call_arguments.done` events
- Added emoji indicator (ðŸ”§) for tool calls

**Result:** Tool call display worked, but audio stopped working

### 2. Modalities Configuration Attempts
**What was tried:**
- Initially had `modalities` commented out (original working state)
- Enabled `modalities: ["audio", "text"]` explicitly
- Tried various combinations

**Code variations tested:**
```python
# Original (supposedly working)
# "modalities": ["audio", "text"], # Optional: Uncomment/adjust if needed

# Attempt 1
"modalities": ["audio", "text"], # Enable both audio and text output

# Attempt 2 - Removed entirely
# No modalities key in payload
```

**Result:** No improvement, track still muted

### 3. Audio Element Debugging
**What was added:**
- Made audio element visible with controls: `<audio controls style="position: fixed; bottom: 10px; right: 10px;">`
- Added extensive console logging for audio element state
- Monitored track properties after 2 seconds
- Added WebRTC track statistics monitoring

**Findings:**
```javascript
// Console output showed:
Track muted: true        // <-- Core issue
Track enabled: true      // Track is enabled
Track readyState: live   // Track is live
Audio element muted: false  // Element itself not muted
Audio element volume: 1.0    // Volume is max
Audio element paused: false  // Playing
```

**Result:** Confirmed track is muted at WebRTC level, not audio element level

### 4. Force Unmute Attempts
**What was tried:**
```javascript
// Attempt to unmute track
audioTrack.enabled = true;
remoteAudio.muted = false;
remoteAudio.volume = 1.0;
remoteAudio.play().then(() => console.log('Playing'));
```

**Result:** No effect - track remains muted at source

### 5. Session Configuration Variations
**Multiple configurations tested:**

```python
# Configuration 1 - Minimal
payload = {
    "model": OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL,
    "voice": "alloy"
}

# Configuration 2 - With turn detection only
payload = {
    "model": OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL,
    "voice": "alloy",
    "turn_detection": {
        "type": "semantic_vad",
        "eagerness": "high"
    }
}

# Configuration 3 - With tools but no modalities
payload = {
    "model": OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL,
    "voice": "alloy",
    # "modalities": ["audio", "text"], # Commented out
    "turn_detection": {...},
    "tools": [...]
}

# Configuration 4 - Full configuration
payload = {
    "model": OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL,
    "voice": "alloy",
    "modalities": ["audio", "text"],
    "turn_detection": {...},
    "tools": [...],
    "instructions": "..."
}
```

**Result:** None of these configurations fixed the audio

### 6. Audio Format Specifications
**What was tried:**
```python
# Added explicit audio format
"input_audio_format": "pcm16",
"output_audio_format": "pcm16",
```

**Result:** No improvement

### 7. Session Update Message
**What was tried:**
```javascript
// Sent after data channel opened
dc.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: "session.update",
    session: {
        modalities: ["text", "audio"],
        voice: "alloy"
    }
}));
```

**Result:** No effect

### 8. Git History Reversions
**Commits tested (from newest to oldest):**
1. `ce2179a` - Before tool call display changes (27 minutes ago)
2. `a9afdfd` - Before tool calling implementation (2 hours ago)
3. `d5ad9a1` - Before voice chat UI redesign (10 hours ago)
4. Earlier commits from the morning

**Result:** Audio issue persisted in ALL versions, suggesting the problem is not code-related

### 9. Test Page Creation
**Created simplified test page (`test_audio.html`):**
- Minimal implementation
- Auto-sends message on connection
- Direct session creation without extra features
- Audio level monitoring with Web Audio API

**Code snippet:**
```javascript
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const source = audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();
// Monitor actual audio data
```

**Result:** Test page showed same issue - track muted

### 10. WebRTC and SDP Analysis
**What was examined:**
- SDP offer and answer for audio codec information
- Checked for audio-related lines in SDP
- Monitored ICE candidates and connection state
- Checked RTP statistics for packet reception

**Findings:**
- Connection established successfully
- Data channel works (transcript proves bidirectional communication)
- Audio track is received but muted at source

## Code Files Involved

### Backend Files
1. **`main.py`**
   - `/session` endpoint creates OpenAI Realtime sessions
   - Handles configuration payload
   - Manages tools and instructions

2. **`realtime_functions.py`**
   - Contains function implementations for tool calling
   - Not directly related to audio issue

3. **`call_center_guide.md`**
   - Instructions for the AI assistant
   - Loaded and sent during session creation

### Frontend Files
1. **`static/script.js`**
   - Main WebRTC implementation
   - Handles peer connection setup
   - Audio track handling in `pc.ontrack`
   - Data channel message processing

2. **`static/print_transcript.js`**
   - Displays transcripts
   - Added tool call display functionality
   - Not directly related to audio issue

3. **`templates/index.html`**
   - UI layout
   - Audio element: `<audio id="remoteAudio" autoplay="true" playsinline="true">`

## Key Observations

1. **Track is muted at source**: The MediaStreamTrack from OpenAI has `muted: true`, preventing any audio playback
2. **Not a browser autoplay issue**: Audio element successfully enters playing state
3. **Not a volume/mute issue**: Audio element has volume=1 and muted=false
4. **Not a code regression**: Issue persists even in much earlier versions
5. **WebRTC connection works**: Data flows bidirectionally (transcript proves this)
6. **Session is created successfully**: OpenAI returns valid session with client_secret

## Possible Root Causes

1. **OpenAI API Issue**
   - API might not be sending audio data
   - Account/API key configuration issue
   - Regional restriction or service issue

2. **Browser/System Issue**
   - Browser WebRTC implementation problem
   - System audio permissions
   - Audio output device configuration

3. **Network Issue**
   - Firewall blocking audio packets
   - WebRTC media ports blocked
   - STUN/TURN server connectivity

4. **Account/Billing Issue**
   - OpenAI account might have audio disabled
   - API key permissions
   - Rate limiting or quota issues

## What Was NOT Tried

1. **Different browser** - User didn't test in Chrome/Firefox/Safari
2. **Different OpenAI API key** - Same key used throughout
3. **Different network** - Same network used
4. **Different audio output device** - System audio settings not changed
5. **OpenAI API status check** - Didn't verify if service was having issues
6. **Raw WebRTC audio test** - Didn't test with non-OpenAI WebRTC

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test in different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. **Check OpenAI API status** at status.openai.com
3. **Test with different API key** if available
4. **Check browser console in other working OpenAI Realtime demos**
5. **Verify system audio output** is working for other applications
6. **Test on different network** (mobile hotspot, etc.)
7. **Create minimal test without any tools/instructions**
8. **Contact OpenAI support** if issue persists
9. **Check if audio works in OpenAI's official playground**
10. **Monitor network tab** for WebRTC media streams

## Final State of Code

The repository was left at commit `6ff382c` with:
- Full tool calling implementation
- Tool call display in transcript
- Audio debugging logs in place
- Visible audio controls for debugging
- All 27 health plans loaded and working
- Modern UI layout

## Server Information

**To restart the server:**
```bash
lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
source venv/bin/activate
nohup python main.py > flask_server.log 2>&1 &
```

**Server runs at:** http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Conclusion

The audio issue appears to be external to the codebase, as reverting to previously working versions did not resolve it. The track being muted at the WebRTC level suggests the issue is either with:
1. OpenAI's API not sending audio data
2. Browser/system configuration
3. Network/firewall blocking audio packets

The user planned to reboot their computer and try again later, which may resolve system-level audio issues.
