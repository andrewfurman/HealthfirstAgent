Create a clean, hierarchical table of contents in markdown format that shows the structure and organization of the document.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS include page numbers when they exist in the document
2. Look for patterns like "page X", "...X", "X" at the end of section titles
3. Extract page numbers from any table of contents already in the document
4. If no explicit TOC exists, look for section headers with page breaks or "Page X of Y" markers

**SPECIAL FOCUS - CALL CENTER REQUIREMENTS:**
You must specifically identify and note pages that contain:
- **COPAYS/COPAYMENTS** - Any pages with copay amounts, copay tables, or copayment information
- **COINSURANCE** - Any pages with coinsurance percentages or coinsurance details
- **DEDUCTIBLES** - Any pages with deductible amounts or deductible information
- **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION** - Any pages listing services requiring prior authorization or PA requirements

When you find these topics, add a note like: "(contains copay info)" or "(contains PA requirements)" after the section title.

The table of contents should:
1. Use simple markdown lists and headers without ANY dots, periods, or dashes as separators
2. Put page numbers (if present) right after the section name with just a space
3. Show all major sections and important subsections
4. Maintain the exact structure as it appears in the document
5. Keep section titles concise - use abbreviations where appropriate
6. **HIGHLIGHT pages with copay, coinsurance, deductible, and prior authorization information**

Format Rules:
- NO dots (.........) between titles and page numbers
- Just use a space and the page number: "Section Name 42"
- Use markdown headers (##, ###) for main sections
- Use bullet points (-) for subsections
- Add special notes for key information: "Section Name 42 (contains copay tables)"
- Keep it clean and minimal

Example format:

## Table of Contents

### A. Disclaimers 2

### B. Frequently asked questions 3

### C. Overview of services 9 (contains copay info)

### D. Additional services CompleteCare covers 31

### E. Benefits covered outside of CompleteCare 32 (contains coinsurance rates)

### F. Services not covered 33 (contains prior authorization requirements)

### G. Your rights and responsibilities 34

### H. How to file a complaint 37

### I. Cost-sharing summary 45 (contains deductible and copay tables)

IMPORTANT: 
- Extract the ACTUAL sections from the document
- NO decorative dots or dashes between text and page numbers
- Keep section names short and clear
- LOOK CAREFULLY for page numbers - they are often present in the original TOC or as "Page X" markers
- If you see patterns like "Section Name.....14" or "Section Name â€” 14", extract the page number as 14
- **SCAN THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT** for any mention of copays, coinsurance, deductibles, or prior authorization and note which pages contain this information
- Call center agents frequently need to reference these specific pages, so accuracy is critical
