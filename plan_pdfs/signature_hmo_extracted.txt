Pre‑Enrollment Checklist
Before making an enrollment decision, it is important that you fully understand our benefits and rules. If you have any 
questions, you can call and speak to a customer service representative at 1‑877‑237‑1303 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821), 
7 days a week, 8am–8pm.
Understanding the Benefits
■
■
■
■
The Evidence of Coverage (EOC) provides a complete list of all coverage and services. It is important to review plan coverage, 
costs, and benefits before you enroll. Visit HFMedicareMaterials.org or call 1‑877‑237‑1303 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) to 
view a copy of the EOC.
Review the provider directory (or ask your doctor) to make sure the doctors you see now are in the Healthfirst network. If they 
are not listed, it means you will likely have to select new doctors, or enroll in a PPO plan to visit out‑of‑network providers.
Review the pharmacy directory to make sure the pharmacy you use for prescription medicines is in the Healthfirst network. 
If the pharmacy is not listed, you will likely have to select a new pharmacy for your prescriptions.
Review the formulary to make sure your drugs are covered.
Understanding the Important Rules
■
■
■
■
■
■
In addition to your monthly plan premium, you must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium. This premium is normally 
taken out of your Social Security check each month.
Benefits, premiums, and/or copayments/coinsurance may change on Jan. 1, 2026.
For an HMO plan, except in emergency or urgent situations, we do not cover services from out‑of‑network providers 
(doctors who are not listed in our provider directory).
For a preferred provider organization plan (PPO), you are allowed to see providers outside of our network (non‑contracted 
providers). However, while we will pay for covered services, the provider must agree to treat you. Except in an emergency or 
urgent situation, non‑contracted providers may deny care. In addition, you will pay a higher copay for services you receive 
from non‑contracted providers. 
For a dual‑eligible special needs plan (D‑SNP), your ability to enroll will be based on verification that you are entitled to both 
Medicare and medical assistance from a state plan under Medicaid.
Effect on Current Coverage. If you are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, your existing plan coverage will end 
once your new Medicare Advantage plan coverage starts. If you currently have TRICARE,® your coverage may be affected 
once your new Medicare Advantage plan coverage starts. Please contact TRICARE for more information. If you have a 
Medigap plan, once your new Medicare Advantage plan coverage starts, you may want to drop your Medigap policy because 
you will be paying for coverage you cannot use.

2025 Summary of Benefits
Healthfirst Signature (HMO) Overview
Healthfirst Signature (HMO) is a Medicare Advantage plan that offers the benefits of 
Original Medicare plus much more.
What makes you eligible to be a plan member?
•
You have both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B 
•
You live in one of these counties: Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond, 
Rockland, Sullivan, or Westchester
•
You are a United States citizen or are lawfully present in the United States
Healthfirst is dedicated to making healthcare easy for you. We can help you maximize your 
benefits, support your health needs, answer your questions, and connect you to the right 
resources, with no referrals needed to see specialists.
If you think you may have Medicaid, Extra Help (also known as Low Income Subsidy), or 
Medicare Savings Program, we may have a plan that is a better fit for you. Call 1‑877‑237‑1303, 
7 days a week, 8am–8pm (TTY English and other languages 1‑888‑542‑3821) 
(TTY Español 1‑888‑867‑4132).
New York State recently changed who is eligible for programs like Medicaid and Medicare Savings 
Program. If you are eligible, Healthfirst can help you enroll. Contact Senior Planning Services 
Community Solutions (SPSCS) at 1‑844‑559‑4219 (Monday to Friday, 9am–5pm) to start an 
application over the phone or to schedule an appointment at a Community Office.
This is a summary document and does not include every covered service, nor does it list every 
limitation or exclusion. For a full list of services, look through this plan’s Evidence of Coverage 
(EOC), which can be found online at HFMedicareMaterials.org. Healthfirst members can call

Important Tips
Use in‑network providers and 
pharmacies.
Healthfirst Signature (HMO) has a network 
of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and other 
providers at 100,000+ locations.* If you 
use providers or pharmacies that are not 
in our network, the plan may not pay for 
those services or drugs, or you may pay 
more than you pay at a pharmacy in the 
Healthfirst network.
Browse our provider/pharmacy 
directory.
The best way to find a doctor or specialist and 
pharmacy in the Healthfirst network is to visit 
HFDocFinder.org. You may also stop by one 
of our convenient community offices (visit 
healthfirst.org to find one near you). Or call 
us at 1‑877‑237‑1303 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) 
for assistance.
Check the Healthfirst formulary.
The formulary is a list of prescription drugs 
(both generic and brand name) covered 
by the health plan. To download a copy 
of this Healthfirst’s plan’s formulary, visit 
HFMedicareMaterials.org. You can also 
pick one up at a Healthfirst Community 
Office, or call us at 1‑877‑237‑1303 (TTY 
1‑888‑542‑3821) for assistance. Find out 
more about your costs for covered drugs later 
in this document.
Healthfirst members can request printed 
copies of our Provider/Pharmacy Directory 
and/or Formulary by calling Member Services 
and we will mail them.
Read the Medicare & You handbook.
This guide from the Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (CMS) helps you 
understand your Medicare choices. Visit 
medicare.gov/medicare‑and‑you to view 
this handbook online or order a copy by 
calling 1‑800‑MEDICARE (1‑800‑633‑4227). 
TTY users should call 1‑877‑486‑2048. 
You can call 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week. You can also download a copy of 
the handbook by visiting medicare.gov/
medicare‑and‑you/medicare‑and‑you.html.
*The number of provider locations is current as of June 24, 2024, 
and subject to change due to periodic changes in our network.

The following are the healthcare costs associated with the Healthfirst Signature (HMO) plan:
Important information
Monthly Premium
$0
You must continue to pay your Medicare Part B 
premium, which starts at $174.70 in 2024 and 
increases based on income.
The Medicare Part B premium amount 
may change for the following year and 
we will provide updated rates as soon as 
Medicare releases them.
If you are having trouble affording your monthly 
Part B premium, contact Member Services 
at 1‑855‑771‑1081 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) 
to see if you may be eligible for a Medicare 
Savings Program.
Medical 
Deductible

(non‑preferred) and Tier 5 (specialty) drugs.
Maximum 
Out‑of‑Pocket 
(MOOP)
$6,700 for 
Medicare‑covered

in‑network providers
If you reach the limit on out‑of‑pocket costs, 
you can keep getting Medicare‑covered hospital 
and medical services and Healthfirst will pay the 
full cost for the rest of the year. 
If you have Original Medicare instead of a 
Healthfirst Medicare Advantage plan, there is no 
cap on what you spend on healthcare!
Note: This does not apply to prescription 
drug costs. You will still need to pay your 
share of the costs for prescription drugs. This 
also does not apply to benefits that are not

Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Coverage
Your drug costs depend on three factors:
1. Your plan’s drug deductible 
2. Your drug’s tier
3. The Part D Prescription Drug Coverage Stage that you’re currently in
There are five drug tiers and three stages of Part D prescription drug coverage (set by the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services). See the chart on the next page.
•
Check the Healthfirst plan’s formulary (list of approved drugs) at healthfirst.org/formularies
to see if your prescription drug is covered and find out which drug tier it’s in. All drugs in Tier 1 
(generic drugs) are not subject to the drug deductible and have a $0 copay.
◦
Healthfirst members can request printed copies of our Provider/Pharmacy Directory and/or 
Formulary by calling Member Services and we will mail them.
•
Starting at the beginning of the year, you pay only the copay for Tiers 2 and 3 drugs, 
without having to pay a deductible first. For Tiers 4 and 5 drugs, you must pay the annual 
$590 deductible out of pocket before the plan helps pay for the costs of these drugs. Once 
you meet the deductible, you will pay the copay or coinsurance for these drugs until you reach 
the initial coverage limit.
•
Next, look at your Part D Prescription Drug Coverage Stage. You start at the Deductible Stage 
and move forward as the total dollars spent on your drugs increases. Depending on which 
stage you’re in, your 30‑day supply cost will change.
◦
Deductible Stage ‑ You pay full cost until deductible is met (Tier 1 drugs are always $0).
◦
Initial Coverage Stage ‑ You pay your share of the drug cost, and your plan 
will pay its share.
◦
Catastrophic Stage ‑ Plan pays the full cost of the drug, so your cost is $0 for the 
remainder of the year.

Important Message About What You Pay for Insulin
You won’t pay more than $35 for a one‑month supply of each insulin product covered by our 
plan, no matter what cost‑sharing tier it’s on, even if you haven’t paid your deductible.
With Healthfirst, you can save even more on your insulin! You can fill a 90‑day supply of insulin 
(in Tiers 1–3) for the same price as a 30‑day supply. Check your Healthfirst Plan Formulary at 
healthfirst.org/formularies to see which insulins we cover.

Getting your prescriptions is easy 
with Healthfirst
Whether it’s your first time filling a prescription or you’re 
getting a third refill, Healthfirst can help make sure you get 
the medications you need.
You have three (3) convenient ways to get your prescriptions:
1. Home Delivery (to your door)
Check with your current pharmacy, since 
many offer free delivery. If they do not, call 
us and we’ll help you find pharmacies near 
you that offer delivery to your doorstep. 
2. Mail Delivery
Ensure you have your maintenance 
medications on hand. Call us for 
help finding a pharmacy that offers 
convenient mail delivery.
3. Neighborhood Pharmacy
Pick up your prescriptions from a local 
pharmacy in your neighborhood:
•
You can go to any pharmacy in the 
Healthfirst network
•
Visit HFDocfinder.org to 
find one near you
There may be some pharmacies near 
you that can provide extra services at no 
additional cost to you, such as:
•
Coordinating your different refills so you 
can pick them all up on the same day, 
at the same time
•
Grouping your daily prescriptions 
in packets so they’re easier 
to take each day
•
Offering health coaching
Call us at 1‑866‑463‑6743 for help finding

Additional Pharmacy Support
If you need help remembering to refill your prescriptions, ask your pharmacist if they could send 
you refill reminders. That way you’ll know when it’s time to pick up your next refill and always have 
enough medication available. It’s important to take your medications as directed by your doctor.
Want more savings and convenience with your prescriptions? Ask your doctor to prescribe 
90‑day supplies of your medications whenever possible. You won’t have to go to the pharmacy 
every month anymore, and a 90‑day supply of some medications can even cost the same as 
a 30‑day supply!
Healthfirst members who need help getting their prescriptions can call the Healthfirst pharmacy 
team at 1‑844‑347‑2955. We’re ready to help you get the medications you need.

cost you, check your plan’s approved drug list at healthfirst.org/formularies. The amount you pay 
depends on the drug’s tier and what stage of the benefit you have reached. In the Medicare Part D 
Prescription Drug Coverage section (page 24), we discussed the benefit stages that occur: 
Deductible Stage, Initial Coverage, and Catastrophic Coverage.
Will I have to pay a monthly premium or deductible?
Healthfirst Signature (HMO) has a $0 premium and a $0 deductible for medical and hospital 
services. There is an annual deductible of $590 for prescription drug tiers 4 and 5. For tiers 1, 2,

2025 Summary of Benefits
Glossary
Ambulatory Surgery Center
A facility that exclusively provides outpatient 
surgical services to patients not requiring 
hospitalization and whose expected stay does 
not exceed 24 hours.
Benefit Period 
A benefit period begins the day you’re admitted 
as an inpatient at a hospital or skilled nursing 
facility (SNF). The benefit period ends when 
you haven’t gotten any inpatient hospital care 
(or skilled care in a SNF) for 60 days in a row. 
If you go into a hospital or a SNF after one 
benefit period has ended, a new benefit period 
begins. There’s no limit to the number of 
benefit periods.
Bone Mass Measurement
Measures bone density to determine whether a 
patient has osteoporosis (bone disease).
Cardiovascular Screening
Test for heart disease. 
Coinsurance
The percentage of costs of a covered 
healthcare service you pay after you’ve 
paid your deductible. Your insurance 
company pays the rest.
Example: A common coinsurance is 20%. 
In this case, after you meet your deductible, 
Healthfirst will pay 80% of the cost. You will pay 
the remaining 20% of the cost.
With Original Medicare, you will pay a 20% 
coinsurance for most outpatient services. 
However, with the Healthfirst Signature (HMO) 
Plan, you’ll pay a lower copay for many of 
those same services.
Colonoscopy
Medical procedure where a long, flexible, 
tubular instrument is used to view the entire 
inner lining of the colon (large intestine) 
and the rectum.
Copayment (or copay) 
A set fee that you pay each time you go to the 
doctor, get a prescription drug filled, or get 
other services.
Example: If your health plan has a $10 PCP 
copayment, you must pay $10 for a checkup 
with your primary care provider (PCP).
Cost Sharing 
The general term for your health expenses, 
including deductibles, coinsurance, 
and copayments.
Covered Service  
A service that you are entitled to and which 
your plan will cover under the terms of your 
plan. Some cost sharing may apply.
CT
Computed tomography is a medical 3‑D 
imaging technique.
Deductible  
The amount of money you must pay (if 
applicable) in covered expenses each year 
before your plan or program pays anything for 
certain covered services. The deductible may 
not apply to all services. 

--- Page 35 ---
Healthfirst Signature (HMO)
Page 33
Example: If your deductible is $500, you need 
to spend $500 for covered healthcare services 
within one year before your plan or program 
will start paying for your health services. Your 
deductible resets at the beginning of the year.
Diabetes Screening 
Test for high blood sugar levels.
Dual‑Eligible Individual
A person who qualifies for both Medicare and 
Medicaid coverage.
Effective Date  
The date on which your plan coverage begins.
Evidence of Coverage (EOC) 
The EOC gives you details about what the plan 
covers, how much you pay, and more.
Explanation of Benefits (EOB)
A form that you will receive that explains the 
treatments you received, the portion of the 
cost that is covered under your plan, and the 
amount left that you may have to pay or may 
have already paid directly to your provider.
Extra Help 
Also known as the “Low‑Income Subsidy.” 
People who qualify for this program get help 
paying their plan’s monthly premiums, as well 
as the yearly deductible and copayments for 
their prescription drugs.
If you are unsure of your Extra Help status, 
contact 1‑877‑237‑1303 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) 
or Social Security at 1‑800‑772‑1213.
Formulary
A list of prescription drugs (both generic and 
brand name) covered by your health plan.
This may also be called a list of Part D 
prescription drugs or Drug List.
Health Maintenance 
Organization (HMO)  
A type of health insurance plan. In most 
HMOs, you can only go to the hospitals, 
doctors, and other healthcare providers that 
have agreements with the plan, except in an

in‑network specialist care.)

2025 Summary of Benefits
Maximum Out‑of‑Pocket (MOOP)
The annual limit on your out‑of‑pocket costs 
for services covered by your plan (i.e., the sum 
of the deductible, copay, and coinsurance 
amounts). Once you reach this amount, you 
do not pay anything for most services. This 
does not include your monthly premium costs, 
any charges from out‑of‑network healthcare 
providers, prescription drugs, or services that 
are not covered by the plan.
Remember, Original Medicare does not have 
a MOOP or any cap on spending, so your 
healthcare expenses can be very high over the 
course of a year.
Medicaid 
A joint federal and state program that helps with 
medical costs for some people with limited 
income and resources. Medicaid programs 
vary from state to state, but most healthcare 
costs are covered if you qualify for both 
Medicare and Medicaid.
Medicare Savings Program  
A Medicaid program that helps people with 
limited income and resources pay some or 
all of their Medicare premiums, deductibles, 
and coinsurance.
MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a 
strong magnetic field to create detailed images 
of your organs and tissues. 
Network 
A group of doctors and hospitals contracted 
to provide healthcare services to members 
of a health plan.
Original Medicare
Fee‑for‑service coverage under which the 
government pays your healthcare providers 
directly for your Part A (Hospital) and/or Part B 
(Medical) benefits.
Out‑of‑Network Provider 
A healthcare provider (doctor or hospital) 
that is not a part of a plan network. You 
will typically pay more if you use a provider 
that is not in your plan network. Except for 
emergency and urgent care services, the plan 
will not cover out‑of‑network care without a 
prior authorization.
Outpatient
Medical services that do not require an 
overnight hospital stay.
Part A
Hospital insurance that helps cover inpatient 
care in hospitals and inpatient stays in a 
Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) (not custodial or 
long‑term care), hospice care services, and 
home health care services.
Part B
Medical insurance that helps cover physician 
services, outpatient care, and other medical 
services that Part A doesn’t cover. Part B 
also covers durable medical equipment 
(e.g. wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds, 
and other equipment) as long as they’re 
medically necessary.

Page 35
Part C
Medicare Advantage (also known as “Part C”) 
is a type of Medicare health plan offered by a 
private company that contracts with Medicare. 
These plans include Part A, Part B, and usually 
Part D. Plans may offer some extra benefits that 
Original Medicare doesn’t cover.
Part D  
A program that helps pay for prescription 
drugs for people with Medicare who join a 
plan that includes Medicare prescription drug 
coverage. There are two ways to get Medicare 
prescription drug coverage: through a Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plan or a Medicare Advantage 
Plan that includes drug coverage. These plans 
are offered by insurance companies and other 
private companies approved by Medicare. Plans 
may also offer prescription drug coverage 
that follows the same rules as Medicare 
Prescription Drug Plans.
Preauthorization/Precertification 
(also known as Prior Authorization)
Some healthcare plans, including Healthfirst, 
require you to check with them before you 
get certain services. This is to make sure that 
these healthcare services are necessary and 
are covered before you get them so that you 
will not be responsible for the entire cost. 
Preauthorization is required for many services, 
but it is not required in an emergency.
Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
A type of health plan that contracts with 
medical providers, such as hospitals and 
doctors, to create a network of participating 
providers. You pay less if you use providers 
that belong to the plan’s network. You can use 
doctors, hospitals, and providers outside of the 
network for an additional cost.
Premium
The amount of money some members must 
pay monthly, quarterly, or twice a year to be 
covered by a health insurance plan or program.
If you are having trouble affording your monthly 
Part B premium, contact us at 1‑877‑237‑1303
(TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) to see if you may be 
eligible for a Medicare Savings Program.
Preventive Care Services
Services you receive from your doctor that help 
prevent disease or to identify disease while it is 
more easily treatable. Under Healthcare Reform, 
most of these services are 100% covered by 
your insurance plan, which means that you will 
not have to pay for them.
Primary Care Provider (PCP)
Your primary doctor (also known as a 
primary care provider or PCP) is the doctor 
who provides you with basic healthcare and 
preventive services to help make sure you stay 
healthy. Your PCP coordinates most of your 
care, and may refer you to specialists. Your 
primary care is covered only when you see your 
PCP, but Healthfirst members may change their 
PCP at any time by calling Member Services.
Referral
A written order from your primary care 
doctor for you to see a specialist or get 
certain services. In many HMOs, you need 
to get a referral before you can get care from 
anyone except your primary care doctor. If 
you don’t get a referral first, the plan may not 
pay for your care.

--- Page 38 ---
Page 36
|
Healthfirst HMO plans do not require you to get a 
referral to see an in‑network specialist.
Special Needs Plan (SNP)
Medicare Special Needs Plans are a type of 
Medicare Advantage plan designed for certain 
types of people with Medicare. Some Special 
Needs Plans are for people with certain chronic 
diseases and conditions, some are for people 
who have both Medicare and Medicaid, and 
some are for people who live in an institution 
such as a nursing home.

Medicare Star Ratings
Understanding the Medicare Star Ratings for your 
Healthfirst Medicare Advantage plan.*
How do Star Ratings work?
The federal government (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, also known as CMS) uses 
information from member satisfaction surveys, plans, and healthcare providers to rate Medicare 
Advantage plans. 
Medicare Advantage plans are rated on how well they perform. Each plan receives a rating that 
ranges from one star (lowest) to five stars (highest). Star Ratings are calculated each year and 
may change from one year to the next.
If you did not receive a copy of the Medicare Star Ratings from your Healthfirst sales 
representative along with this booklet, please visit HFMedicareMaterials.org or call Healthfirst at 
1‑888‑260‑1010 (TTY 1‑888‑542‑3821) to get a copy.
*Every year Medicare evaluates plans based on a 5‑star rating system.
