Important Questions
Answers
Why This Matters:
What is the overall 
deductible? 
$0 
See the Common Medical Events chart below for your costs for services this plan covers.
Are there services 
covered before you 
meet your 
deductible? 
Yes. Preventive care, prenatal care and 
telemedicine are covered before you 
meet your deductible 
This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible 
amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers 
certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. 
See a list of covered preventive services at 
https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/
Are there other 
deductibles for 
specific services? 
No. 
You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services. 
What is the out-of- 
pocket limit for this 
plan? 
Individual $2,000/ 
Family $4,000 
The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. 
What is not included in 
the out-of-pocket limit? 
Premium, Balance Billing charges and the 
cost of health care services this plan does 
not cover. 
Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out–of–pocket limit. 
Will you pay less if you 
use a network 
provider? 
Yes. See www.healthfirst.org or call 1-
888-250-2220 for a list of network
providers. 
This plan uses a provider network. You will pay less if you use a provider in the 
plan’s network. You will pay the most if you use an out-of-network provider, and you 
might receive a bill from a provider for the difference between the provider’s charge 
and what your plan pays (balance billing). Be aware, your network provider might 
use an out-of-network provider for some services 
Do you need a referral 
to see a specialist? 
You can see the specialist you choose without a referral. 
No.
