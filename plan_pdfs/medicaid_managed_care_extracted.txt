What kind of care 
do I need? 
If you’re not sure where 
to go for healthcare, 
here’s a quick and easy 
guide: 
•	 For primary care 
such as checkups 
and vaccinations, 
you should see your 
PCP (main doctor)
•	 For specialty care, 
like skincare or foot 
care, you should see 
a specialist 
•	 When your PCP 
is not available 
and you have an 
immediate but 
non‑life‑threatening 
health problem, 
you should go to a 
retail health clinic or 
urgent care center
💰
Avoid surprise costs
Your plan doesn’t 
cover out‑of‑network 
benefits, except 
for emergency 
care, urgent care, 
renal dialysis, and 
some other special 
circumstances.  
Before you schedule 
an appointment, make 
sure your provider is in 
the Healthfirst network.
A provider is your: 
•	 doctor;
•	 specialist;
•	 hospital;
•	 lab;
•	 and retail 
health clinic.
Your healthcare options
As a Healthfirst member, you have access to the care you need to 
be healthy, including:
Primary Care
Your PCP is the doctor you go to for your healthcare needs. They can 
be a general doctor, an OB/GYN, or (in some cases) a specialist.
Specialty Care
You don’t need a referral to see in‑network specialists. However, 
you should talk to your PCP first. They can help you find the right 
specialist based on your health concern. 
Retail Health Clinics
These clinics are inside retail pharmacy stores (such as Minute Clinic 
at CVS). Visit for walk‑in care (without an appointment), even during 
evenings and weekends.
Urgent Care
Access immediate, non‑emergency care at urgent care centers for 
health issues such as: 
•	
Infections
•	
Upset stomach
•	
Fevers
•	
Sprains
•	
Minor fractures and 
broken bones
•	
Stitches
•	
X‑rays
•	
And more
Emergency Care
If you have an emergency, always call 911 or visit the nearest 
emergency room, especially if you think waiting will worsen your 
condition. Emergencies are things like:
•	
Uncontrollable bleeding
•	
Poisoning
•	
Loss of consciousness
•	
Chest pain
•	
Severe allergic reaction
•	
Behavioral health issues 
(severe anxiety, depression, 
substance overdose etc.)
You don’t need preauthorization for immediate emergency care. 
However, please call Healthfirst within 48 hours to let us know 
you’ve been treated in an emergency room.
For a complete list of all your covered medical services, please 
see pages 15–30. You may also call Member Services at 
1‑866‑463‑6743 or visit MyHFNY.org.

Renewing your 
Medicaid Managed Care plan
The easiest way to renew your Medicaid Managed Care plan is 
to call us at 1‑844‑201‑8346. You can make an appointment by 
phone, visit us at one of our community offices, or schedule an 
in‑home visit and we’ll come to you. 
Do I need to renew my Medicaid Managed Care plan?
Yes. Your plan generally expires one year after you signed up, and 
you need to renew your health plan every year.
When do I need to renew? 
•	
If you’re enrolled through NY State of Health (NYSOH), your 
application is due the 15th of the month your plan ends. 
(For example, if your plan ends January 31, your application 
would be due January 15.)
•	
If you’re enrolled through the Human Resources 
Administration (HRA) or Local Department of Social Services 
(LDSS), your paper application is due the 10th of the month 
before your plan’s end date. (For example, if your plan ends 
January 31, your application would be due December 10.)
•	
If you’re enrolled through HRA or LDSS and get cash assistance 
or housing, you must re‑enroll with your case manager. 
Will I be notified before my coverage expires? 
Yes. You’ll get a notice from NYSOH, HRA, or LDSS. Healthfirst will 
also reach out to you by mail, email, SMS text, or phone.
Please note: If you get a paper renewal packet in the mail at 
two different times, New York State and CMS advise you to 
complete, sign, and return both renewal applications to keep your 
coverage active.
What happens if I don’t renew?
Your coverage will expire. If you get sick or injured, you won’t have 
health coverage—even in an emergency—and you will have to pay 
for any care received.

YOUR MEMBER HANDBOOK HAS BEEN CHANGED TO INCLUDE MORE 
SERVICES  
Starting January 1, 2025, you can connect to organizations in your community that 
provide services to help with housing, food, transportation, and care management, at no 
cost to you, through a regional Social Care Network (SCN). 
 
• Through this SCN, you and your child can meet with a Social Care Navigator 
who can check your eligibility for services that can help with your health and well-
being. They will ask you some questions to see where you might need some 
extra support. 
 
• If you or your child qualify for services, the Social Care Navigator can work with 
you to get the support you need. You may qualify for more than one service, 
depending on your situation. These services include: 
 
o Housing and utilities support:   
 Installing home modifications like ramps, handrails, and grab bars 
to make your home accessible and safe.  
 Repairing and fixing water leaks to prevent mold from growing in 
your home.  
 Sealing holes and cracks to prevent pests from entering your home. 
 Providing an air conditioner, heater, humidifier, or dehumidifier to 
help improve ventilation in your home. 
 Helping you find and apply for safe and stable housing in the 
community. 
 
o Nutrition support: 
 Getting help from a nutrition expert who will give you guidance and 
support in choosing healthy foods to meet your health needs and 
goals. 
 Getting prepared meals, fresh produce, or grocery items delivered 
to your home for up to six (6) months. These food items will be 
tailored to your specific health needs.  
 Providing cooking supplies like pots, pans, microwave, refrigerator, 
and utensils to prepare meals.  

--- Page 14 ---
 
o Transportation services: 
 Helping you with access to public or private transportation to places 
approved by the SCN such as: going to a job interview, parenting 
classes, housing court to prevent eviction, local farmers’ markets, 
and city or state department offices to obtain important documents. 
 
o Care management services: 
 Getting help with finding a job or job training program, applying for 
public benefits, managing your finances, and more. 
 Getting connected to services like childcare, counseling, crisis 
intervention, health homes program, and more. 
A list of SCNs is attached. If you are interested, please call the SCN in your region. The 
Social Care Navigator will verify your eligibility, tell you more about these services, and 
help you get connected to them.  
If you have any questions about this information, please call Member Services at 1-866-

Highlighted text indicates newly added language.  
 
Benefits You Can Get from Healthfirst OR with Your Medicaid Card  
For some services, you can choose where to get the care. You can get these services 
by using your Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care Member ID card. You can also go to 
providers who will take your Medicaid Benefit card. You do not need a referral from your 
PCP to get these services. Call us at 1-866-463-6743 if you have questions.  
Family Planning  
You can go to any doctor or clinic that takes Medicaid and offers family planning 
services. You can visit one of our family planning providers as well. Either way, you do 
not need a referral from your PCP. You can get birth control drugs, birth control devices 
(IUDs and diaphragms) that are available with a prescription, plus emergency 
contraception, sterilization, pregnancy testing, prenatal care, and abortion services. You 
can also see a family planning provider for HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) 
testing and treatment, and for counseling related to your test results. Screenings for 
cancer and other related conditions are also included in family planning visits. 
You can request that Healthfirst send any communication regarding family planning 
services to a different address or through a different way. To update your family 
planning communication preference, please call Member Services at 1-866-463-6743.

Doula Services 
 
This is an important notice about your Medicaid Managed Care plan benefits. Please read it 
carefully. If you have any questions, please call us at 1-866-463-6743.  
 
Starting April 1, 2025, Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care will cover doula services during 
pregnancy and up to 12 months after the end of pregnancy, no matter how the pregnancy  
ends. Currently, members can access doula services by using their Medicaid card. Beginning  
April 1, 2025, you can use your Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care plan card to receive  
doula services. 
 
What is a Doula? 
Doulas provide physical, emotional, educational, and non-medical support for pregnant and 
postpartum persons before, during, and after childbirth or end of pregnancy. 
 
What Doula Services are Available? 
 
Doula services can include up to eight (8) visits with a doula during and after pregnancy and 
continuous support while in labor and during childbirth. If you become pregnant within the 12 
months following a prior pregnancy, your eligibility for doula services will start over with the new 
pregnancy. Any unused doula services from the prior pregnancy will not carry over. 
 
Doula services may include:  
• 
The development of a birth plan;  
• 
Ongoing support throughout the pregnancy; 
• 
Continuous support during labor and childbirth; 
• 
Education and information on pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenting;  
• 
Assisting with communication between you and your medical providers; and  
• 
Connecting you to community-based childbirth and parenting resources.  
 
Eligibility 
If you are pregnant or have been pregnant within the last 12 months, you are eligible for doula 
services. You are eligible for these services with each pregnancy. 
 
If you started to receive doula services with a Medicaid-enrolled doula(s) before April 1, 2025, 
your doula services will continue to be covered until 12 months after the end of your pregnancy. 

--- Page 19 ---
If you start to receive doula services on or after April 1, 2025, your doula needs to participate 
with Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care. 
To learn more about these services, please call Member Services at 1-866-463-6743 (TTY 1-
888-542-3821), Monday to Friday, 8am–6pm.

Welcome to Healthfirst’s 
Medicaid Managed Care Program
We are glad that you enrolled in Healthfirst. This handbook will be your guide to the full range of 
healthcare services available to you. We want to be sure you get off to a good start as a new member. 
In order to get to know you better, we will get in touch with you in the next two or three weeks. 
You can ask us any questions you have, or get help making appointments. If you need to speak with 
us before we call you, however, just call us at 1‑866‑463‑6743. 
How Managed Care Plans Work
The Plan, Our Providers, and You
Managed care provides a central home for your care. 
•	
We have a group of healthcare providers to meet your needs. These doctors and specialists, 
hospitals, labs, and other healthcare facilities make up our provider network. Our provider 
network is listed in our provider directory. To get a provider directory, call 1‑866‑463‑6743 
or visit our website at HFDocFinder.org.
•	
When you join Healthfirst, you will need to choose a primary care provider (PCP) from our 
provider network. If you need to have a test, see a specialist, or go into the hospital, your PCP will 
arrange it. 
•	
Even though your PCP is your main source for healthcare, in some cases you can self‑refer to 
certain doctors for some services. See page 9 for details. 
Your PCP is available to you every day, day and night. If you need to speak to them after hours or 
on weekends, leave a message and how you can be reached. Your PCP will get back to you as soon 
as possible. 
You may be restricted to certain plan providers if you have been identified as a restricted recipient. 
Below are examples of why you may be restricted:
•	
getting care from several doctors for the same problem
•	
getting medical care more often than needed
•	
using prescription medicine in a way that may be dangerous to your health
•	
allowing someone other than yourself to use your plan ID card
Confidentiality
We respect your right to privacy. Healthfirst recognizes the trust needed between you, your family, 
your doctors, and other care providers. Healthfirst will never give out your medical or behavioral health 
history without your written approval. The only persons that will have your clinical information will be 
Healthfirst, your PCP, your authorized representative, and other providers who give you care. Referrals 
to such providers will always be discussed with you in advance by your PCP or your Health Home Care 
Manager, if you have one. Healthfirst staff have been trained in keeping strict member confidentiality.

How to Use This Handbook
This handbook will help you when you join a managed care plan. It will tell you how your new health 
care system will work and how you can get the most from Healthfirst. This handbook is your guide to 
health and wellness services. It tells you the steps to take to make the plan work for you.
The first several pages will tell you what you need to know right away. Use this handbook for 
reference or check it out a bit at a time.
When you have a question, check this handbook or call our Member Services unit. You can also call 
the managed care staff at your Local Department of Social Services (LDSS).
If you live in any boroughs of New York City, or in Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Rockland, 
Sullivan, or Westchester County, you can also call the New York Medicaid Choice Help Line at 
1‑800‑505‑5678.
Help From Member Services
There is someone to help you at Member Services:
phone Member Services: 1‑866‑463‑6743

•	
You can call Member Services to get help anytime you have a question. You may call us to 
choose or change your PCP, to ask about benefits and services, to get help with referrals, to 
replace a lost ID card, to let us know if you are pregnant or have a new baby, or ask about any 
change that might affect you or your family’s benefits.
•	
If you are or become pregnant, your child will become part of Healthfirst on the day they are 
born. This will happen unless your newborn child is in a group that cannot join managed care. You 
should call us and your LDSS right away if you become pregnant and let us help you to choose a 
doctor for your baby before they are born.
•	
We offer free sessions to explain our health plan and how we can best help you. It’s a great time 
for you to ask questions and meet other members. If you’d like to come to one of the sessions, 
call us to find a time and place that is best for you. 
•	
If you do not speak English, we can help. We want you to know how to use your healthcare plan 
no matter what language you speak. Just call us and we will find a way to talk to you in your own 
language. We have a group of people who can help. We will also help you find a PCP who can 
serve you in your language.

For people with disabilities: If you use a wheelchair, are blind, or have trouble hearing or 
understanding, call us if you need extra help. We can tell you if a particular provider’s office 
is wheelchair accessible or is equipped with special communications devices. Also, we have 
services like:
	◦
TTY machine (Our TTY phone number is 1‑888‑542‑3821)
	◦
Information in large print
	◦
Case management
	◦
Help in making or getting to appointments
	◦
Names and addresses of providers who specialize in your disability
•	
If you or your child are getting care in your home now, your nurse or attendant may not 
know you have joined our plan. Call us right away to make sure your home care does not 
stop unexpectedly. 
Your Health Plan ID Card
After you enroll, we will send you a Welcome Letter. Your Healthfirst ID card should arrive within 
14 days after your enrollment date. Your card has your PCP’s name and phone number on it. It will 
also have your Client Identification Number (CIN). If anything is wrong on your Healthfirst ID card, call 
us right away. Your ID card does not show that you have Medicaid or that Healthfirst is a special type 
of health plan. 
Carry your ID card at all times and show it each time you go for care. If you need care before the 
card comes, your welcome letter is proof that you are a member of Healthfirst. You should keep your 
Medicaid benefit card. You will need this card to get services that Healthfirst does not cover.

Part I: First Things You Should Know
How To Choose Your Primary Care Provider (PCP)
•	
You may have already picked your PCP to serve as your regular doctor. This person could be a 
doctor, nurse practitioner, or other healthcare provider. If you have not chosen a PCP for you 
and your family, you should do so right away. If you do not choose a doctor within 30 days from 
when you receive your welcome packet, we will choose one for you. 
•	
Each family member can have a different PCP, or you can choose one PCP to take care of 
the whole family. A pediatrician treats children. Family practice doctors treat the whole family. 
Internal medicine doctors treat adults. You may see your PCP at a Behavioral Health Clinic. 
Member Services (1‑866‑463‑6743) can check to see if you already have a PCP or help 
you choose one.
•	
With this handbook, you should have a provider directory. This is a list of all the doctors, clinics, 
hospitals, labs, and others who work with Healthfirst. It lists the address, phone number, and 
special training of the doctors. The provider directory will show which doctors and providers 
are taking new patients. You should call their offices to make sure that they are taking new 
patients at the time you choose a PCP. You can also get a list of providers on our website at 
HFDocFinder.org.
You may want to find a doctor that:
	◦
you have seen before 
	◦
understands your health problems
	◦
is taking new patients
	◦
can serve you in your language
	◦
is easy to get to
Women can also choose one of our Ob/Gyn doctors to deal with women’s healthcare. 
•	
We also contract with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). All FQHCs give primary and 
specialty care. Some consumers want to get their care from FQHCs because the centers have a 
long history in the neighborhood. Maybe you want to try them because they are easy to get to. 
You should know that you have a choice. You can choose any one of the providers listed in our 
directory, or you can sign up with a primary care physician at one of the FQHCs that we work with 
listed below. Just call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743 for help.
You can also see a list of FQHCs at HFDocFinder.org or on the Healthfirst NY Mobile App.
•	
In almost all cases, your doctors will be Healthfirst providers. There are four instances when 
you can still see another provider that you had before you joined Healthfirst. In these cases, 
your provider must agree to work with Healthfirst. You can continue to see your doctor if:
	◦
You are more than three months pregnant when you join Healthfirst and you are getting 
prenatal care. In that case, you can keep your provider until after your delivery through 
post‑partum care. This post‑partum care continues up to 12 weeks after delivery.

Behavioral health crisis assistance is available 24/7
Page 7
	◦
At the time you join Healthfirst, you have a life‑threatening disease or condition that gets worse 
with time. In that case, you can ask to keep your provider for up to 60 days.
	◦
At the time you join Healthfirst, regular Medicaid paid for your home care and you need to 
keep getting that care for at least 120 days. In that case, you can keep your same home care 
agency, nurse, or attendant, and the same amount of home care, for at least 90 days. 
	◦
At the time you join Healthfirst, you are being treated for a Behavioral Health condition. In most 
cases, you can still go to the same provider. Some people may have to choose a provider that 
works with the health plan. Be sure to talk to your provider about this change. Healthfirst will 
work with you and your provider to make sure you keep getting the care you need.
Healthfirst must tell you about any changes to your home care before the changes take effect.
•	
If you have a long‑lasting illness, like HIV/AIDS or other long-term health problems, you 
may be able to choose a specialist to act as your PCP. Please call Member Services at 
1‑866‑463‑6743 for help.
•	
If you need to, you can change your PCP in the first 30 days after your first appointment with your 
PCP. After that, you can change before the 1st of every month without cause, or more often if 
you have a good reason. You can also change your Ob/Gyn or a specialist to whom your PCP has 
referred you.
•	
If your provider leaves Healthfirst, we will tell you within 15 days from when we know about this. 
If you wish, you may be able to see that provider if you are more than three months pregnant or if 
you are receiving ongoing treatment for a condition. If you are pregnant, you may continue to see 
your doctor for up to 12 weeks after delivery. If you are seeing a doctor regularly for an ongoing 
condition, you may continue your present course of treatment for up to 90 days. Your doctor must 
agree to work with Healthfirst during this time.
•	
If any of these conditions apply to you, check with your PCP or call Member Services at 
1‑866‑463‑6743.
How To Get Regular Care
•	
Regular healthcare means exams, regular checkups, shots or other treatments to keep you well, 
advice when you need it, and referral to the hospital or specialists when needed. It means you and 
your PCP working together to keep you well or to see that you get the care you need.
•	
Day or night, your PCP is only a phone call away. Be sure to call your PCP whenever you have a 
medical question or concern. If you call after hours or weekends, leave a message and where or 
how you can be reached. Your PCP will call you back as quickly as possible. Remember, your PCP 
knows you and knows how the health plan works. 
•	
Your care must be medically necessary. The services you get must be needed:
1.	 to prevent, or diagnose and correct what could cause more suffering;
2.	 to deal with a danger to your life; 
3.	 to deal with a problem that could cause illness; or 
4.	 to deal with something that could limit your normal activities.

--- Page 27 ---
Page 8  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
•	
Your PCP will take care of most of your healthcare needs, but you must have an appointment to 
see your PCP. If ever you can’t keep an appointment, call to let your PCP know. 
•	
As soon as you choose a PCP, call to make a first appointment. If you can, prepare for your first 
appointment. Your PCP will need to know as much about your medical history as you can tell 
them. Make a list of your medical background, any problems you have now, any medications you 
are taking, and the questions you want to ask your PCP. In most cases, your first visit should be 
within three months of your joining Healthfirst.
•	
If you need care before your first appointment, call your PCP’s office to explain your concern. 
They will give you an earlier appointment. You should still keep the first appointment to discuss 
your medical history and ask questions.
•	
Use the following list as an appointment guide for our limits on how long you may have to wait 
after your request for an appointment:
	◦
adult baseline and routine physicals: within 12 weeks
	◦
urgent care: within 24 hours
	◦
non‑urgent sick visits: within 3 days
	◦
routine, preventive care: within 4 weeks
	◦
follow‑up visit after mental health/substance abuse emergency room (ER) or inpatient 
visit: 5 days 
	◦
non‑urgent mental health or substance abuse visit: 1 week 
•	
Use the following list as an appointment guide for our limits on how long you may have to wait 
after your request for a perinatal appointment:
	◦
first trimester: visit must occur within 3 weeks of the request for care
	◦
second trimester: visit must occur within 2 weeks of the request for care
	◦
third trimester: visit must occur within 1 week of the request for care
	◦
first newborn visit: within 2 weeks of hospital discharge
	◦
initial family planning visit must occur within 2 weeks of the request for care 
	◦
for specialist referrals and urgent matters during pregnancy:
	▪
urgent specialist referrals must be seen as soon as clinically indicated, not to 
exceed 72 hours
	▪
non‑urgent specialist referrals must be seen as soon as clinically indicated, not to exceed 
2 to 4 weeks of when the request was made
	▪
for non‑emergent, but urgent matters, pregnant persons must be seen within 24 hours of 
request for care 
How To Get Specialty Care – Referral
•	
If you need care that your PCP cannot give, they will REFER you to a specialist who can. If your 
PCP refers you to another doctor, we will pay for your care. Most of these specialists are Healthfirst 
providers. Talk with your PCP to be sure you know how referrals work. 
•	
If you think a specialist does not meet your needs, talk to your PCP. Your PCP can help you if you 
need to see a different specialist.
•	
There are some treatments and services that your PCP must ask Healthfirst to approve before you 
can get them. Your PCP will be able to tell you what they are.

•	
If you are having trouble getting a referral you think you need, contact Member Services at 
1‑866‑463‑6743.
•	
If we do not have a specialist in our provider network who can give you the care you need, we 
will get you the care you need from a specialist outside our plan. This is called an out‑of‑network 
referral. Your PCP or plan provider must ask Healthfirst for approval before you can get an 
out‑of‑network referral. If your PCP or plan provider refers you to a provider who is not in our 
network, you are not responsible for any of the costs except any copayments as described in 
this handbook.
•	
If you believe that Healthfirst does not have a specialist in our provider network that can give 
you the care that you need, you can request services from an out‑of‑network specialist by 
contacting Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743. We will need a written reason why you need to 
see a specialist that is not in our network. You can ask your PCP or other provider to send us this 
information on your behalf. We will follow the same rules and timeframes for Prior Authorization 
requests outlined on pages 31–34.
	◦
Sometimes we may not approve an out‑of‑network referral because we have a provider in 
Healthfirst that can treat you. If you think our plan provider does not have the right training or 
experience to treat you, you can ask us to check if your out‑of‑network referral is medically 
needed. You will need to ask for a Plan Appeal. See page 37 to find out how.
	◦
Sometimes, we may not approve an out‑of‑network referral for a specific treatment because 
you asked for care that is not very different from what you can get from a Healthfirst provider. 
You can ask us to check if your out‑of‑network referral for the treatment you want is medically 
needed. You will need to ask for a Plan Appeal. See page 37 to find out how. 
•	
If you need to see a specialist for ongoing care, your PCP may be able to refer you for a specified 
number of visits or length of time (a standing referral). If you have a standing referral, you will not 
need a new referral for each time you need care. 
•	
If you have a long‑term disease or a disabling illness that gets worse over time, your PCP may be 
able to arrange for: 
	◦
your specialist to act as your PCP 
	◦
a referral to a specialty care center that deals with the treatment of your illness
	◦
a call to Member Services for help in getting access to a specialty care center
Get These Services From Healthfirst Without A Referral 
Women’s Healthcare
You do not need a referral from your PCP to see one of our providers if: 
•	
you are pregnant
•	
you need Ob/Gyn services
•	
you need family planning services
•	
you want to see a midwife
•	
you need to have a breast or pelvic exam

--- Page 29 ---
Page 10  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
Family Planning
•	
You can get the following family planning services: advice about birth control, birth control 
prescriptions, male and female condoms, pregnancy tests, sterilization, and an abortion. During 
your visits for these things, you can also get tests for sexually transmitted infections, a breast 
cancer exam, or a pelvic exam. 
•	
You do not need a referral from your PCP to get these services. In fact, you can choose where 
to get these services. You can use your Healthfirst ID card to see one of our family planning 
providers. Check our Provider Directory or call Member Services for help in finding a provider. 
•	
Or, you can use your Medicaid card if you want to go to a doctor or clinic outside our plan. 
Ask your PCP or call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743 for a list of places to go to get these 
services. You can also call the New York State Growing Up Healthy Hotline (1‑800‑522‑5006) for 
the names of family planning providers near you.
HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Screening
Everyone should know their HIV status. HIV and STI screenings are part of your regular healthcare. 
•	
You can get an HIV or STI test any time you have an office or clinic visit. 
•	
You can get an HIV or STI test any time you have family planning services. You do not need 
a referral from your PCP. Just make an appointment with any family planning provider. If you 
want an HIV or STI test, but not as part of a family planning service, your PCP can provide or 
arrange it for you.
•	
Or, if you’d rather not see one of our providers, you can use your Medicaid card to see a family 
planning provider outside Healthfirst’s network. For help in finding either a plan provider or a 
Medicaid provider for family planning services, call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743.
•	
Everyone should talk to their doctor about having an HIV test. To get free HIV testing or testing 
where your name isn’t given, call 1‑800‑541‑AIDS (English) or 1‑800‑233‑SIDA (Spanish).
Some tests are “rapid tests” and the results are ready while you wait. The provider who gives you the 
test will explain the results and arrange for follow-up care if needed. You will also learn how to protect 
your partner. If your test is negative, we can help you learn to stay that way.
Eye Care
The covered benefits include the needed services of an ophthalmologist, optometrist, and an 
ophthalmic dispenser, and include an eye exam and pair of eyeglasses, if needed. Generally, you can 
get these once every two years, or more often if medically needed. Enrollees diagnosed with diabetes 
may self‑refer for a dilated eye (retinal) examination once in any 12-month period. You must choose 
one of our participating providers. 
New eyeglasses, with Medicaid-approved frames, are usually provided once every two years. New 
lenses may be ordered more often, if, for example, your vision changes more than one‑half diopter. If 
you break your glasses, they can be repaired. Lost eyeglasses, or broken eyeglasses that can’t be fixed, 
will be replaced with the same prescription and style of frames. If you need to see an eye specialist for 
care of an eye disease or defect, your PCP will refer you.

Behavioral Health – (Mental Health and Substance Use)
We want to help you get the mental health and substance use services you need. If at any time you 
think you need help with mental health or substance use, you can see behavioral health providers in 
our network to see what services you may need. This includes services like clinic and detox services. 
You do not need a referral from your PCP.
Smoking Cessation
You can get medication, supplies and counseling if you want help to quit smoking. You do not need a 
referral from your PCP to get these services. 
Maternal Depression Screening
If you are pregnant or recently had a baby and think you need help with depression, you can get a 
screening to see what services you may need. You do not need a referral from your PCP. You can get

Emergencies
You are always covered for emergencies.
An emergency means a medical or behavioral condition:
•	
that comes on all of a sudden, and
•	
has pain or other symptoms. 
An emergency would make an average person fear that they, or someone, will suffer serious harm 
without care right away.
Examples of emergencies are: 
•	
a heart attack or severe chest pain
•	
bleeding that won’t stop
•	
a bad burn
•	
broken bones
•	
trouble breathing, convulsions, or loss of consciousness
•	
when you feel you might hurt yourself or others
•	
if you are pregnant and have signs like pain, bleeding, fever, or vomiting
•	
drug overdose

--- Page 31 ---
Page 12  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
Examples of non‑emergencies are: 
•	
colds
•	
sore throat
•	
upset stomach
•	
minor cuts and bruises 
•	
sprained muscles
Non‑emergencies may also be family issues, a break up, or wanting to use alcohol or other drugs. 
These may feel like an emergency, but they are not a reason to go to the emergency room.
If you have an emergency, here’s what to do:
If you believe you have an emergency, call 911 or go to the emergency room. You do not need your 
plan’s or your PCP’s approval before getting emergency care, and you are not required to use our 
hospitals or doctors. 
•	
If you’re not sure, call your PCP or Healthfirst.
Tell the person you speak with what is happening. Your PCP or member services 
representative will:
	◦
tell you what to do at home
	◦
tell you to come to the PCP’s office, or
	◦
tell you to go to the nearest emergency room
•	
If you are out of the area when you have an emergency:
	◦
Go to the nearest emergency room. If you are discharged from the emergency room with 
prescriptions, they must be filled at an NYRx Medicaid‑enrolled pharmacy.
bell Remember
You do not need prior approval for emergency services. Use the emergency room only if you 
have an emergency.
The emergency room should NOT be used for problems like the flu, sore throats, or 
ear infections.
If you have questions, call your PCP, or Healthfirst at 1‑866‑463‑6743.

Urgent Care
You may have an injury or an illness that is not an emergency but still needs prompt care. 
•	
This could be a child with an earache who wakes up in the middle of the night and won’t 
stop crying.
•	
This could be the flu or if you need stitches.
•	
It could be a sprained ankle, or a bad splinter you can’t remove. 
You can get an appointment for an urgent care visit for the same or next day. Whether you are 
at home or away, call your PCP any time, day or night. If you cannot reach your PCP, call us at 
1‑866‑463‑6743. Tell the person who answers what is happening. They will tell you what to do.
Care Outside of the United States
If you travel outside of the United States, you can get urgent and emergency care only in the District 
of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American 
Samoa. If you need medical care while in any other country (including Canada and Mexico), you will

Benefits You Can Get From Healthfirst Or With Your 
Medicaid Card
For some services, you can choose where to get the care. You can get these services by using your 
Healthfirst membership card. You can also go to providers who will take your Medicaid Benefit card. 
You do not need a referral from your PCP to get these services. Call us if you have questions at 
1‑866‑463‑6743.	
Family Planning 
You can go to any doctor or clinic that takes Medicaid and offers family planning services. You 
can visit one of our family planning providers as well. Either way, you do not need a referral 
from your PCP.
You can get birth control drugs, birth control devices (IUDs and diaphragms) that are available with 
a prescription, plus emergency contraception, sterilization, pregnancy testing, prenatal care, and 
abortion services. You can also see a family planning provider for HIV and sexually transmitted 
infection (STI) testing and treatment, and counseling related to your test results. Screenings for cancer 
and other related conditions are also included in family planning visits.
HIV and STI Screening (when receiving this service as part of a family planning visit) 
Everyone should know their HIV status. HIV and sexually transmitted infection screenings are part of 
your regular health care. 
•	
You can get an HIV or STI test any time you have an office or clinic visit. 
•	
You can get an HIV or STI test any time you have family planning services. You do not need 
a referral from your PCP (Primary Care Provider). Just make an appointment with any family 
planning provider. If you want an HIV or STI test, but not as part of a family planning service, your 
PCP can provide or arrange it for you.
•	
If you’d rather not see one of our Healthfirst providers, you can use your Medicaid card to see a 
family planning provider outside Healthfirst. For help in finding either a Plan provider or a Medicaid 
provider for family planning services call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743.
•	
Everyone should talk to their doctor about having an HIV test. To get free HIV testing or testing 
where your name isn’t given, call 1‑800‑541‑AIDS (English) or 1‑800‑233‑SIDA (Spanish).

Some tests are “rapid tests” and the results are ready while you wait. The provider who gives you the 
test will explain the results and arrange for follow up care if needed. You will also learn how to protect 
your partner. If your test is negative, we can help you learn to stay that way.
You can ask your PCP for a list of places to get these services or call Member Services 
at 1‑866‑463‑6743. You can also call the New York State Growing Up Healthy Hotline 
(1‑800‑522‑5006) for nearby places to get these services.
Tuberculosis (TB) Diagnosis and Treatment
You can choose to go either to your PCP or to the county public health agency for diagnosis and/or 
treatment. You do not need a referral to go to the county public health agency.
Benefits Using Your Medicaid Card Only
There are some services Healthfirst does not provide. You can get these services from a provider who 
takes Medicaid by using your Medicaid Benefit card.
Pharmacy
You can get prescriptions, over‑the‑counter medicines, enteral formulas, and some medical supplies 
from any pharmacy that takes Medicaid. A copayment may be required for some people, for some 
medications and pharmacy items.
Certain medications may require that your doctor get prior authorization from Medicaid before the 
pharmacy can dispense your medication. Getting prior authorization is a simple process for your 
doctor and does not prevent you from getting medications that you need.
Do you have questions or need help? The Medicaid Helpline can assist you. They can talk to you in 
your preferred language. They can be reached at 1‑800‑541‑2831 (TTY 1‑800‑662‑1220). 
They can answer your call:
Monday to Friday, 8am–8pm
Saturday, 9am–1 pm
Transportation 
Emergency and/or non‑emergency medical transportation will be covered by regular Medicaid. To 
get non‑emergency transportation, you or your provider must call Medical Answering Services at: 
•	
1‑844‑666‑6270 if you live New York City, on Long Island, or in Westchester County
•	
1‑866‑932‑7740 if you live in Orange, Rockland, or Sullivan counties
If possible, you or your provider should call Medical Answering Services at least 3 days before your 
medical appointment and provide your Medicaid identification number (ex. AB12345C), appointment 
date and time, address where you are going, and doctor you are seeing. Non‑emergency medical 
transportation includes: personal vehicle, bus, taxi, ambulette and public transportation. 

--- Page 49 ---

non‑covered services (listed above)
•	
unauthorized services
•	
services provided by providers not part of Healthfirst
If You Get a Bill
If you get a bill for a treatment or service you do not think you should pay for, do not ignore it. Call 
Healthfirst at 1‑866‑463‑6743 right away. Healthfirst can help you understand why you may have 
gotten a bill. If you are not responsible for payment, Healthfirst will contact the provider and help fix 
the problem for you. 
You have the right to ask for a plan appeal if you think you are being asked to pay for something 
Medicaid or Healthfirst should cover. See the Plan Appeal section later in this handbook. 
If you have any questions, call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743.

Service Authorization
Prior Authorization: 
There are some treatments and services that you need to get approval for before you receive them or 
in order to be able to continue receiving them. This is called prior authorization. You, your provider, 
or someone you trust can ask for this. The following treatments and services must be approved 
before you get them:
•	
All out‑of‑network services (non‑emergent services)
•	
Acute rehabilitation admissions
•	
All cosmetic surgery (medically necessary)
•	
All elective admissions to a hospital
•	
Air ambulance
•	
DME (diabetic and dressing supplies do not require authorization)
•	
Electromyogram (EMG)/nerve conduction studies
•	
Home health services
•	
Home Care InteliHealth Monitoring
•	
Pain management services
•	
Physical/occupational therapy
•	
Therapy/speech therapy
•	
Procedures and equipment for erectile dysfunction
•	
Skilled nursing facility admissions
•	
Transplant
•	
Injectable 
•	
Dental (Not all dental services require prior authorization. However, some may, such as implants, 
dentures, and crowns. If so, your provider will have to contact DentaQuest at 1‑800‑508‑2047.)
•	
Vision/glasses (Please remember that for you to receive this service, your provider will have to 
contact EyeMed at 1‑844‑844‑0886.)
Asking for approval of a treatment or service is called a service authorization request. To get approval 
for these treatments or services you or your doctor need to: 
Call our toll‑free Member Services number at 1‑866‑463‑6743 or send your request in writing to:
Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care Plan
100 Church Street
New York, NY 10007
For preauthorization or to notify Healthfirst of an admission, please contact:
Medical Management Department
Phone: 1‑888‑394‑4327; Fax: 1‑646‑313‑4603
Monday to Friday, 8:30am–5:30pm

Page 32  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
You will also need to get prior authorization if you are getting one of these services now but need to 
continue or get more of the care. This is called concurrent review. 
What happens after we get your service authorization request:
Healthfirst has a review team to be sure you get the services you need. We check that the service you 
are asking for is covered under your health plan. Doctors and nurses and dentists (for dental‑related 
pre‑authorization requests) are on the review team. Their job is to be sure the treatment or service 
you asked for is medically needed and right for you. They do this by checking your treatment plan 
against medically acceptable standards. 
We may decide to deny a service authorization request or to approve it for an amount that is less than 
requested. These decisions will be made by a qualified health care professional. If we decide that the 
requested service is not medically necessary, the decision will be made by a clinical peer reviewer, 
who may be a doctor or may be a health care professional who typically provides the care you 
requested. You can request the specific medical standards, called clinical review criteria, we use to 
make decisions about medical necessity.
After we get your request, we will review it under a standard or fast track process. You or your doctor 
can ask for a fast track review if it is believed that a delay will cause serious harm to your health. If 
your request for a fast track review is denied, we will tell you and your case will be handled under the 
standard review process. 
We will fast track your review if: 
•	
A delay will seriously risk your health, life, or ability to function
•	
Your provider says the review must be faster
•	
You are asking for more a service you are getting right now
In all cases, we will review your request as fast as your medical condition requires us to do so but no 
later than mentioned below. 
We will tell you and your provider both by phone and in writing if your request is approved or denied. 
We will also tell you the reason for the decision. We will explain what options for appeals or fair 
hearings you will have if you don’t agree with our decision. (See also the Plan Appeals and Fair Hearing 
sections later in this handbook.) 
Timeframes for prior authorization requests:
•	
Standard review: We will make a decision about your request within 3 work days of when we have 
all the information we need, but you will hear from us no later than 14 days after we receive your 
request. We will tell you by the 14th day if we need more information.
•	
Fast track review: We will make a decision and you will hear from us within 72 hours. We will tell 
you within 72 hours if we need more information.

Timeframes for concurrent review requests:
•	
Standard review: We will make a decision within 1 work day of when we have all the information 
we need, but you will hear from us no later than 14 days after we received your request. We will 
tell you by the 14th day if we need more information.
•	
Fast track review: We will make a decision within 1 work day of when we have all the information 
we need. You will hear from us no later than 72 hours after we received your request. We will tell 
you within 1 work day if we need more information. 
Special timeframes for other requests:
•	
If you are in the hospital or have just left the hospital and you are asking for home health care we 
will make a decision within 72 hours of your request. 
•	
If you are getting inpatient substance use disorder treatment, and you ask for more services 
at least 24 hours before you are to be discharged, we will make a decision within 24 hours of 
your request.
•	
If you are asking for mental health or substance use disorder services that may be related to a 
court appearance, we will make a decision within 72 hours of your request.
•	
If you are asking for a practitioner administered drug when provided in an outpatient hospital, 
clinic, or doctor’s office, we will make a decision within 24 hours of your request, after your health 
care provider has provided Healthfirst with a completed prior authorization form with all necessary 
information included to review the request. 
•	
A step therapy protocol means we require you to try another drug first before we will approve 
the drug you are requesting. If you are asking for approval to override a step therapy protocol, 
we will make a decision within 24 hours for practitioner administered drugs when provided in 
an outpatient hospital, clinic, or physician’s office, after your health care provider has provided 
Healthfirst with a completed prior authorization form with all necessary information included to 
review the request.
If we need more information to make either a standard or fast track decision about your service 
request, we will:
•	
Write and tell you what information is needed. If your request is in a fast track review, we will call 
you right away and send a written notice later.
•	
Tell you why the delay is in your best interest.
•	
Make a decision no later than 14 days from the day we asked for more information.
You, your provider, or your representative may also ask us to take more time to make a decision. This 
may be because you have more information to give us to help decide your case. This can be done by 
calling 1‑888‑394‑4327 or writing to:
Healthfirst Medical Management Department
P.O. Box 5166
New York, NY 10274‑5166

--- Page 53 ---
Page 34  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
You or your representative can file a complaint with Healthfirst if you don’t agree with our decision to 
take more time to review your request. You or someone you trust can also file a complaint about the 
review time with the New York State Department of Health by calling 1‑800‑206‑8125.
We will notify you by the date our time for review has expired. But if for some reason you do not hear 
from us by that date, it is the same as if we denied your service authorization request. If we do not 
respond to a request to override a step therapy protocol on time, your request will be approved. 
If you think our decision to deny your service authorization request is wrong, you have the right to file 
a Plan Appeal with us. See the Plan Appeal section later in this handbook.
Other Decisions About Your Care:
Sometimes we will do a concurrent review on the care you are receiving to see if you still need the 
care. We may also review other treatments and services you have already received. This is called 
retrospective review. We will tell you if we make these decisions.
Timeframes for other decisions about your care:
•	
In most cases, if we make a decision to reduce, suspend or stop a service we have already 
approved and you are now getting, we must tell you at least 10 days before we change the service.
•	
We must tell you at least 10 days before we make any decision about long term services 
and supports, such as home health care, personal care, CDPAS, adult day health care, and 
nursing home care. 
•	
If we are checking care that has been given in the past, we will make a decision about paying 
for it within 30 days of receiving all information we need for the retrospective review. If we deny 
payment for a service, we will send a notice to you and your provider the day the payment is 
denied. These notices are not bills. You will not have to pay for any care you received that was 
covered by Healthfirst or by Medicaid even if we later deny payment to the provider.
How Our Providers Are Paid
You have the right to ask us whether we have any special financial arrangement with our providers 
that might affect health care. You can call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743 if you have specific 
concerns. Most of our providers are paid in one or more of the following ways:
•	
Most PCPs who work in a clinic or health center, get a salary. The number of patients they see 
does not affect their salary.
•	
PCPs who work from their own offices may get a set fee each month for each patient for whom 
they are the PCP. The fee stays the same regardless of the number of times the patient visits the 
PCP. This is called capitation.
•	
Providers may get a set fee for each person on their patient list, but some money may be held 
back for an incentive fund. At the end of the year, PCPs who have met the incentive standards set 
by Healthfirst receive additional payments.
•	
Providers may also receive fee‑for‑service payment. This means they get a set fee for each service 
they provide.

Disenrollment And Transfers
If You Want to Leave Healthfirst
You can try us out for 90 days. You may leave Healthfirst and join another health plan at any time 
during that time. If you do not leave in the first 90 days, however, you must stay in Healthfirst for nine 
more months, unless you have a good reason (good cause) to leave our plan. 
Some examples of good cause include:
•	
Our health plan does not meet New York State requirements and members are harmed 
because of it
•	
You move out of our service area
•	
You, Healthfirst, and the LDSS all agree that disenrollment is best for you
•	
You are or become exempt or excluded from managed care
•	
We have not been able to provide services to you as we are required to under our contract 
with the State
To change plans:
If you’ve enrolled through your local Department of Social Services (LDSS):
•	
Call the Managed Care staff at your LDSS
•	
If you live in one of the five boroughs of New York City, or in Nassau, Suffolk, Orange, Rockland, 
Sullivan, or Westchester County, call New York Medicaid Choice at 1‑800‑505‑5678. The New 
York Medicaid Choice counselors can help you change health plans
If you’ve enrolled through NY State of Heath:
•	
Log in to your NY State of Health account at www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov, or
•	
Meet with an enrollment assistor to receive assistance with updating your account, or
•	
Call the NY State of Health Customer Service Center at 1‑855‑355‑5777 (TTY 1‑800‑662‑1220).
You may be able to transfer to another plan over the phone. If you have to be in managed care, you 
will have to choose another health plan.
It may take between two and six weeks to process depending on when your request is received. You 
will get a notice that the change will take place by a certain date. Healthfirst will provide the care you 
need until then. 
You can ask for faster action if you believe the timing of the regular process will cause added damage 
to your health. You can also ask for faster action if you have complained because you did not agree to 
the enrollment. Call your local Department of Social Services or New York Medicaid Choice.

•	
You or your child may have to leave Healthfirst if you or the child:
	◦
move out of the County or service area
	◦
change to another managed care plan 
	◦
have access to an HMO or other insurance plan through work
	◦
go to prison, or

If you have to leave Healthfirst or become ineligible for Medicaid, all of your services may 
stop unexpectedly, including any care you receive at home. Call New York Medicaid Choice at 
1‑800‑505‑5678 right away if this happens.
We Can Ask You to Leave Healthfirst
You can also lose your Healthfirst membership if you often: 
•	
refuse to work with your PCP regarding your care,
•	
don’t follow Healthfirst’s rules,
•	
do not fill out forms honestly or do not give true information (commit fraud), 
•	
cause abuse or harm to plan members, providers or staff, or
•	
act in ways that make it hard for us to do our best for you and other members even after we have 
tried to fix the problems
Plan Appeals
There are some treatments and services that you need to get approval for before you receive them or 
in order to be able to continue receiving them. This is called prior authorization. Asking for approval 
of a treatment or service is called a service authorization request. This process is described earlier in 
this handbook. The notice of our decision to deny a service authorization request or to approve it for 
an amount that is less than requested is called an Initial Adverse Determination. 
If you are not satisfied with our decision about your care, there are steps you can take.
Your provider can ask for reconsideration:
If we made a decision that your service authorization request was not medically necessary or was 
experimental or investigational; and we did not talk to your doctor about it, your doctor may ask to 
speak with our Medical Director. The Medical Director will talk to your doctor within one work day.

--- Page 57 ---
Page 38  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
You Can File a Plan Appeal:
If you think our decision about your service authorization request is wrong, you can ask us to look at 
your case again. This is called a Plan Appeal.
•	
You have 60 calendar days from the date of the Initial Adverse Determination notice to ask for a 
Plan Appeal.
•	
You can call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743 if you need help asking for a Plan Appeal or 
following the steps of the appeal process. We can help if you have any special needs like a hearing 
or vision impairment, or if you need translation services.
•	
You can ask for a Plan Appeal, or you can have someone else, like a family member, friend, doctor 
or lawyer, ask for you. You and that person will need to sign and date a statement saying you want 
that person to represent you. 
•	
We will not treat you any differently or act badly toward you because you ask for a Plan Appeal. 
CIRCLE‑EXCLAMATION  Aid to continue while appealing a decision about your care:
If we decided to reduce, suspend or stop services you are getting now, you may be able to 
continue the services while you wait for your Plan Appeal to be decided. You must ask for your 
Plan Appeal:
•	
Within ten days from being told that your care is changing or
•	
By the date the change in services is scheduled to occur, whichever is later
If your Plan Appeal results in another denial you may have to pay for the cost of any continued 
benefits that you received.
You can call or write to ask for a Plan Appeal. When you ask for a Plan Appeal, or soon after, you will 
need to give us: 
•	
Your name and address
•	
Enrollee number
•	
Service you asked for and reason(s) for appealing
•	
Any information that you want us to review, such as medical records, doctors’ letters or other 
information that explains why you need the service. 
•	
Any specific information we said we needed in the Initial Adverse Determination notice.
•	
To help you prepare for your Plan Appeal, you can ask to see the guidelines, medical records and 
other documents we used to make the Initial Adverse Determination. If your Plan Appeal is fast 
tracked, there may be a short time to give us information you want us to review. You can ask to 
see these documents or ask for a free copy by calling 1‑866‑463‑6743.

If we said that the service you asked for is not very different from a service available from a 
participating provider, you can ask us to check if this service is medically necessary for you. You 
will need to ask your doctor to send this information with your Plan Appeal:
1.	 a statement in writing from your doctor that the out of network service is very different from 
the service the plan can provide from a participating provider. Your doctor must be a board 
certified or board eligible specialist who treats people who need the service you are asking for.
2.	 two medical or scientific documents that prove the service you are asking for is more helpful 
to you and will not cause you more harm than the service the plan can provide from a 
participating provider. 
If your doctor does not send this information, we will still review your Plan Appeal. However, you 
may not be eligible for an External Appeal. See the External Appeal section later in this handbook.
•	
lf you think our participating provider does not have the correct training or experience to provide 
a service, you can ask us to check if it is medically necessary for you to be referred to an out of 
network provider. You will need to ask your doctor to send this information with your appeal:
1.	 a statement in writing that says our participating provider does not have the correct training 
and experience to meet your needs, and 
2.	 a recommendation to an out of network provider with the correct training and experience who 
is able to provide the service. 
Your doctor must be a board certified or board eligible specialist who treats people who need the 
service you are asking for. If your doctor does not send this information, we will still review your 
Plan Appeal. However, you may not be eligible for an External Appeal. See the External Appeal 
section later in this handbook.
What happens after we get your Plan Appeal:
•	
Within 15 days, we will send you a letter to let you know we are working on your Plan Appeal.
•	
We will send you a free copy of the medical records and any other information we will use to 
make the appeal decision. If your Plan Appeal is fast tracked, there may be a short time to review 
this information. 
•	
You can also provide information to be used in making the decision in person or in writing. Call 
Healthfirst at 1‑866‑463‑6743 if you are not sure what information to give us.
•	
Plan Appeals of clinical matters will be decided by qualified health care professionals who did not 
make the first decision, at least one of whom will be a clinical peer reviewer. 

--- Page 59 ---
Page 40  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
•	
Non‑clinical decisions will be handled by persons who work at a higher level than the people who 
worked on your first decision.
•	
You will be given the reasons for our decision and our clinical rationale, if it applies. The notice 
of the Plan Appeal decision to deny your request or to approve it for an amount that is less than 
requested is called a Final Adverse Determination. 
•	
If you think our Final Adverse Determination is wrong:
	◦
you can ask for a Fair Hearing. See the Fair Hearing section of this handbook.
	◦
for some decisions, you may be able to ask for an External Appeal. See the External Appeal 
section of this handbook. 
	◦
you may file a complaint with the New York State Department of Health at 1‑800‑206‑8125.
Timeframes for Plan Appeals:
•	
Standard Plan Appeals: If we have all the information we need, we will tell you our decision within 
30 calendar days from when you asked for your Plan Appeal. 
•	
Fast track Plan Appeals: If we have all the information we need, fast track Plan Appeal decisions 
will be made in 2 working days from your Plan Appeal but not more than 72 hours from when you 
asked for your Plan Appeal. 
	◦
We will tell you within 72 hours if we need more information. 
	◦
If your request was denied when you asked for more inpatient substance use disorder 
treatment at least 24 hours before you were to leave the hospital, we will make a decision 
about your appeal within 24 hours. 
	◦
We will tell you our decision by phone and send a written notice later.
Your Plan Appeal will be reviewed under the fast track process if:
•	
you or your doctor asks to have your Plan Appeal reviewed under the fast track process. Your 
doctor would have to explain how a delay will cause harm to your health. If your request 
for fast track is denied, we will tell you and your Plan Appeal will be reviewed under the 
standard process; or
•	
your request was denied when you asked to continue receiving care that you are now getting or 
need to extend a service that has been provided; or
•	
your request was denied when you asked for home health care after you were in the hospital; or
•	
your request was denied when you asked for more inpatient substance use disorder treatment at 
least 24 hours before you were to leave the hospital.
If we need more information to make either a standard or fast track decision about your Plan 
Appeal, we will:
•	
Write you and tell you what information is needed. If your request is in a fast track review, we will 
call you right away and send a written notice later
•	
Tell you why the delay is in your best interest
•	
Make a decision no later than 14 days from the day we asked for more information

You or your representative may also ask us to take more time to make a decision. This may be 
because you have more information to give Healthfirst to help decide your case. This can be done by 
calling 1‑866‑463‑6743 or writing. 
You or your representative can file a complaint with Healthfirst if you don’t agree with our decision to 
take more time to review your Plan Appeal. You or someone you trust can also file a complaint about 
the review time with the New York State Department of Health by calling 1‑800‑206‑8125.
If you do not receive a response to your Plan Appeal or we do not decide in time, including 
extensions, you can ask for a Fair Hearing. See the Fair Hearing section of this handbook. 
The original denial will be reversed and your service authorization request will be approved if we do 
not decide your Plan Appeal on time and we said the service you are asking for is: 
1.	 not medically necessary, or
2.	 experimental or investigational, or
3.	 not different from care you can get in the plan’s network, or
4.	 available from a participating provider who has correct training and experience to 
meet your needs.
External Appeals
You have other appeal rights if we said the service you are asking for was: 
1.	 not medically necessary
2.	 experimental or investigational
3.	 not different from care you can get in the plan’s network 
4.	 available from a participating provider who has correct training and experience to meet your needs
For these types of decisions, you can ask New York State (NYS) for an independent External Appeal. 
This is called an External Appeal because it is decided by reviewers who do not work for the health 
plan or NYS. These reviewers are qualified people approved by NYS. The service must be in the plan’s 
benefit package or be an experimental treatment, clinical trial, or treatment for a rare disease. You do 
not have to pay for an External Appeal. 
Before you ask for an External Appeal:
•	
You must file a Plan Appeal and get the plan’s Final Adverse Determination or 
•	
If you have not gotten the service, and you ask for a fast track Plan Appeal, you may ask for an 
expedited External Appeal at the same time. Your doctor will have to say an expedited External 
Appeal is necessary or 
•	
You and Healthfirst may agree to skip our appeals process and go directly to External Appeal or
•	
You can prove Healthfirst did not follow the rules correctly when processing your Plan Appeal
You have four months after you receive Healthfirst’s Final Adverse Determination to ask for an 
External Appeal. If you and Healthfirst agreed to skip our appeals process, then you must ask for the 
External Appeal within 4 months of when you made that agreement. 

--- Page 61 ---
Page 42  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
To ask for an External Appeal, fill out an application and send it to the Department of Financial 
Services. You can call Member Services at 1‑866‑463‑6743 if you need help filing an appeal. You 
and your doctors will have to give information about your medical problem. The External Appeal 
application says what information will be needed.
Here are some ways to get an application:
•	
Call the Department of Financial Services, 1‑800‑400‑8882
•	
Go to the Department of Financial Services’ web site at www.dfs.ny.gov. 
•	
Contact the health plan at 1‑866‑463‑6743
Your External Appeal will be decided in 30 days. More time (up to five work days) may be needed if the 
External Appeal reviewer asks for more information. You and Healthfirst will be told the final decision 
within two days after the decision is made.
You can get a faster decision if:
•	
Your doctor says that a delay will cause serious harm to your health: or
•	
You are in the hospital after an emergency room visit and the hospital care is denied by your plan.
This is called an Expedited External Appeal. The External Appeal reviewer will decide an expedited 
appeal in 72 hours or less.
If you asked for inpatient substance use disorder treatment at least 24 hours before you were to leave 
the hospital, we will continue to pay for your stay if:
•	
you ask for a fast track Plan Appeal within 24 hours, AND
•	
you ask for a fast track External Appeal at the same time.
We will continue to pay for your stay until there is a decision made on your appeals. We will make a 
decision about your fast track Plan Appeal in 24 hours. The fast track External Appeal will be decided 
in 72 hours.
The External Appeal reviewer will tell you and the plan the decision right away by phone or fax. Later, 
a letter will be sent that tells you the decision.
If you ask for a Plan Appeal, and you receive a Final Adverse Determination that denies, reduces, 
suspends or stops your service, you can ask for a Fair Hearing. You may ask for a Fair Hearing or ask 
for an External Appeal, or both. If you ask for both a Fair Hearing and an External Appeal, the decision 
of the fair hearing officer will be the one that counts.
Fair Hearings
You may ask for a Fair Hearing from New York State if:
•	
You are not happy with a decision your Local Department of Social Services or the State 
Department of Health made about your staying or leaving Healthfirst
•	
You are not happy with a decision we made to restrict your services. You feel the decision limits 
your Medicaid benefits. You have 60 calendar days from the date of the Notice of Intent to Restrict 

--- Page 62 ---

Page 43
to ask for a Fair Hearing. If you ask for a Fair Hearing within 10 days of the Notice of Intent to 
Restrict, or by the effective date of the restriction, whichever is later, you can continue to get your 
services until the Fair Hearing decision. However, if you lose your Fair Hearing, you may have to 
pay the cost for the services you received while waiting for the decision. 
•	
You are not happy with a decision that your doctor would not order services you wanted. You 
feel the doctor’s decision stops or limits your Medicaid benefits. You must file a complaint with 
Healthfirst. If we agree with your doctor, you may ask for a Plan Appeal. If you receive a Final 
Adverse Determination, you will have 120 calendar days from the date of the Final Adverse 
Determination to ask for a state Fair Hearing.
•	
You are not happy with a decision that we made about your care. You feel the decision limits your 
Medicaid benefits. You are not happy we decided to:
	◦
reduce, suspend or stop care you were getting	  
	◦
deny care you wanted 
	◦
deny payment for care you received 
	◦
did not let you dispute a co‑pay amount, other amount you owe or payment you made for 
your health care
You must first ask for a Plan Appeal and receive a Final Adverse Determination. You will have 120 
calendar days from the date of the Final Adverse Determination to ask for a Fair Hearing. 
If you asked for a Plan Appeal and receive a Final Adverse Determination that reduces, 
suspends, or stops care you are getting now, you can continue to get the services your doctor 
ordered while you wait for your Fair Hearing to be decided. You must ask for a fair hearing 
within 10 days from the date of the Final Adverse Determination or by the time the action takes 
effect, whichever is later. However, if you choose to ask for services to be continued, and you 
lose your Fair Hearing, you may have to pay the cost for the services you received while waiting 
for a decision.
•	
You asked for a Plan Appeal, and the time for us to decide your Plan Appeal has expired, including 
any extensions. If you do not receive a response to your Plan Appeal or we do not decide in time, 
you can ask for a Fair Hearing.
The decision you receive from the fair hearing officer will be final.
You can use one of the following ways to request a Fair Hearing:

Page 44  |  Medicaid Member Handbook
When you ask for a Fair Hearing about a decision Healthfirst made, we must send you a copy of the 
evidence packet. This is information we used to make our decision about your care. The plan will 
give this information to the hearing officer to explain our action. If there is not time enough to mail 
it to you, we will bring a copy of the evidence packet to the hearing for you. If you do not get your 
evidence packet by the week before your hearing, you can call 1‑866‑463‑6743 to ask for it.
Remember, you may complain anytime to the New York State Department of Health by calling 
1‑800‑206‑8125.
Complaint Process

procedure described below.

certain health information for treatment, 
payment, or our operations.
 
–  We are not required to agree to your 
request, and we may say “no” if it would

you would be in danger if we did not say 
yes, then we must agree to your request.
Get a list of those with whom we’ve  
shared information

of attorney, that person can exercise  
your rights and make choices about  
your premium billing, claims, and

authority and can act for you before we 
take any action.

your diagnosis and treatment plan so we can 
arrange additional services.

participate in our OHCA. This information 
may include visit and clinical information 
including admissions, discharge and transfer 
notifications, blood pressure readings, body

coverage. This does not apply to long-
term care plans.
Example: We use health information about you 
to develop better services for you.
Pay for your health services
We can use and disclose your health 
information as we pay for your health services.
Example: We share information about you with 
your dental plan to coordinate payment for 
your dental work.
Administer your plan
We may disclose your health information

provide a health plan, and we provide your 
company with certain statistics to explain the 
premiums we charge.
How else can we use or share your  
health information? 
We are allowed or required to share your 
information in other ways—usually in ways that 
contribute to the public good, such as public 
health and research. We have to meet many 
conditions in the law before we can share 
your information for these purposes. For more 
information, see www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/

or funeral director

Respond to lawsuits and legal actions 
We can share health information about you in 
response to a court or administrative order, or 
in response to a subpoena.
For certain health information, you 
can tell us your choices about what 
we share.
If you have a clear preference for how we 
share your information in the situations 
described below, talk to us. Tell us what 
you want us to do, and we will follow your 
instructions.
In these cases, you have both the right and 
choice to tell us to
 
–  share information with your family, close 
friends, or others involved in payment for 
your care.
 
–  share information in a disaster  
relief situation.
If you are not able to tell us your preference—
for example, if you are unconscious—we may 
go ahead and share your information if we 
believe it is in your best interest. We may  
also share your information when needed  
to lessen a serious and imminent threat to 
health or safety.
 
–  We will never share your information for 
marketing purposes without your written 
permission.
 
– We will never sell your information.
Our Responsibilities
 
–  We are required by law to maintain the 
privacy and security of your protected  
health information.

occurs that may have compromised the 
privacy or security of your information.

User Disorder (SUD) information without 
your permission.
 
–  We must follow the duties and privacy 
practices described in this notice and  
give you a copy of it. 

--- Page 77 ---
 
–  We must comply with additional  
New York State laws that have a  
higher level of protection for personal 
information, particularly information 
relating to HIV/AIDS status or treatment; 
mental health; substance use disorder;  
and family planning.
Collecting, Sharing, 
and Safeguarding Your 
Financial Information 
In addition to health information, Healthfirst 
may collect other information about you and 
your dependents (referred to as personally 
identifiable information, or PII) in the normal 
course of business in order to provide 
healthcare service to you, such as
 
–  information we receive directly or 
indirectly from you or city/state 
governmental agencies through  
eligibility and enrollment applications  
and other forms, such as: name, address, 
date of birth, Social Security number, 
marital status, dependent information, 
assets, and income tax returns.
 
–  information about your transactions 
with us, our affiliated healthcare 
providers, or others, including, but 
not limited to, appeals and grievance 
information, claims for benefits, premium 
payment history, and coordination of 
benefits information. This also includes 
information regarding your health 
benefits and health risk assessments.
 
–  How Your PII is Used or Disclosed with 
Third Parties
We do not disclose your PII to anyone 
without your written authorization, 
except as permitted by law 
(i.e., authorizing requests for healthcare 
services, payment of claims for services, 
ensuring quality improvement and 
assurance practices, resolving appeals or 
grievance inquiries, and any disclosure 
required to applicable governmental 
agencies). If we were to do so in the 
future, we will notify you of such change 
in policy and advise you of your right to 
instruct us not to make such disclosure

physical, electronic, and procedural 
safeguards that comply with federal 
and state regulations to guard your PII.

send you a special consent form to complete and 
sign before we disclose your information.

Healthfirst employees who need to know that 
information in order to provide services to you.

violate our confidentiality or security policies are 
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination of employment.
Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998
In accordance with the Women’s Health and 
Cancer Rights Act of 1998, your Healthfirst plan 
covers the following procedures for a person 
receiving benefits for a mastectomy:
 
–  All stages of reconstruction of the breast on 
which a mastectomy has been performed;
 
–  Surgery and reconstruction of the other 
breast to produce a symmetrical or 
balanced appearance;
 
–  Prostheses (artificial replacements) and 
treatment for physical complications of 
all stages of the mastectomy, including 
lymphedemas.
 
–  Treatment of physical complications of the 
mastectomy, including lymphedema.
This coverage will be subject to the same 
annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions 
that apply to the mastectomy. For answers 
to questions about this plan’s coverage of 
mastectomies and reconstructive surgery, 
call Member Services at the number on your 
Member ID card.
Your Member Rights  
and Responsibilities
Your Rights
As a member of Healthfirst, you have  
a right to:
 
–  Be cared for with respect, without  
regard to health status, sex, race, color, 
religion, national origin, age, marital status, 
or sexual orientation.
 
–  Be told where, when, and how to get the 
services you need from Healthfirst.
 
–  Be told by your PCP and other healthcare 
providers what is wrong, what can be done 
for you, and what will likely be the result in a 
language you understand.
 
– Get a second opinion about your care.
 
–  Give your consent to any treatment 
or plan for your care after that plan has 
been fully explained to you.
 
–  Refuse care and be told what you may risk if 
you do.
 
–  Get a copy of your medical records and 
talk about it with your PCP or healthcare 
provider, and ask, if needed, that your 
medical records be amended or corrected.
 
–  Be sure that your medical records are 
private and will not be shared with anyone 
except as required by law, contract, or with 
your approval.
 
–  Use the Healthfirst complaint system, or 
to contact the New York State Department 
of Health or New York State Department 
of Financial Services any time you feel you 
were not fairly treated.
 
–  Appoint someone (relative, friend, lawyer, 
etc.) to speak for you if you are unable to 
speak for yourself about your care and 
treatment.
 
–  Receive considerate and respectful care 
in a clean and safe environment free of 
unnecessary restraints.
Your Responsibilities
As a member of Healthfirst, you agree to:
 
–  Work with your PCP to guard and improve  
your health.

--- Page 80 ---
 
–  Find out how your healthcare system works.
 
–  Listen to your PCP’s advice and ask 
questions when you are in doubt.
 
–  Call or go back to your PCP if you do not 
get better, or ask for a second opinion.
 
–  Treat healthcare staff with the respect you 
expect yourself.
 
–  Tell us if you have problems with any 
healthcare staff. Call Member Services.
 
–  Keep your appointments. If you must 
cancel, call as soon as you can.
 
–  Use the emergency room only for  
real emergencies.
 
–  Call your PCP when you need medical care, 
even if it is after hours.
How are Healthfirst providers paid?
We want you to know that most of  
our providers are paid in one or more of the 
following ways:
 
–  Our Primary Care Providers (PCPs) may  
get a set fee each month for each patient 
for whom they are the PCP. The fee stays 
the same whether the patient needs one 
visit or many—or even none at all. This is 
called capitation.
 
–  Sometimes PCPs get a set fee for each 
person on their patient list, but some 
money can be held back for a healthcare 
quality incentive fund. At the end of 
the year, this fund is used to recognize 
PCPs who have met Healthfirst’s standards 
for the quality of the healthcare services 
they provide to Healthfirst members and 
how satisfied our members are with them 
as a provider.
 
–  Providers may also be paid by  
fee-for-service. This means they get  
an agreed-upon fee for each service  
they provide.
How can I find out more information about 
payments to providers?
You have the right to ask us whether we have any 
special financial arrangement with our providers 
that might affect your use of healthcare services. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please 
call the Member Services number on the back of 
your Member ID card for assistance.
Pursuant to federal rules that implement the Affordable Care Act, individual health insurance policies must be written on a calendar 
year basis beginning in 2015. This means that, for 2023 coverage, if your effective date of coverage is a date later than January 1, 
the initial term of coverage for your policy will be for less than a full year and will end on December 31, 2023. Please be advised that 
all benefits and cost sharing under your policy, including the full annual deductible, apply to the partial year of coverage. Please refer 
to the Schedule of Benefits in your enclosed policy for the dollar amount of your deductible.
