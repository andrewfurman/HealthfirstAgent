Below is an updated matrix that fills the two “Not found” gaps with **official Member Handbooks and related documents** I located on Healthfirst’s site and NY‐State sources. These handbooks are not SBCs, but they are the next-best public documents that spell out covered and non-covered services, member rights, pharmacy rules, and key phone numbers.
