## Medicaid Managed Care (Includes HARP – Personal Wellness Plan)

**Plan Summary:**

| **Benefit/Feature**           | **Details**                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deductible (Individual)**   | \$0                                                     |
| **Out-of-Pocket Max**         | \$0 (Medicaid does not impose OOP costs)                |
| **Network Type**              | Managed Care (HMO-style, in-network only)               |
| **Primary Care Visit**        | \$0 copay                                               |
| **Specialist Visit**          | \$0 copay (referral may be required)                    |
| **Emergency Room**            | \$0 copay                                               |
| **Hospital Stay (Inpatient)** | \$0 copay                                               |
| **Prescription Drugs**        | \$0 copay (covered under NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program) |

**Coverage:** Healthfirst Medicaid Managed Care covers all essential Medicaid benefits with no member cost-sharing. This includes **doctor visits, hospital services, emergency care, prenatal/maternity care, mental health services, and prescription drugs**. **Vision and dental care** are also covered for both children and adults at no cost. Members have access to **unlimited PCP and specialist visits** and preventive services without co-pays.

**Health and Recovery Plan (HARP):** Eligible Medicaid members age 21+ are enrolled in the Personal Wellness Plan (Healthfirst’s HARP) which **offers all Medicaid benefits plus additional behavioral health services**. These extra services focus on **community support, education/employment support, peer and family support, and crisis management** for those with significant mental health or substance use needs. HARP members can receive specialized Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) such as psychosocial rehabilitation, community psychiatric support, and other recovery-oriented services at no cost.

**Limits/Exclusions:** Medicaid Managed Care generally **has no cost-sharing limits** for covered services (all covered services are \$0 to the member). **Non-covered services** include those not deemed medically necessary or outside Medicaid’s scope (e.g., cosmetic procedures). For HARP, enrollment requires meeting New York State’s eligibility (serious behavioral health needs as determined by the state).

**Referrals & Prior Authorization:** Members **select a PCP** who coordinates care. Referrals may be needed for certain specialists (except direct-access services like OB/GYN or dental) – for example, **no referral is needed to see a dentist**. **Prior authorization is required for certain services** such as elective hospital admissions, some surgeries, durable medical equipment, and home care services. In HARP, a plan care manager coordinates behavioral health services, and HCBS require prior approval and a plan of care. Emergency services do not require prior approval.

## Essential Plan (EP)

**Plan Summary:** *(New York Essential Plan for low-income individuals who don’t qualify for Medicaid. There are four variants: EP 1, 2, 3, 4 based on income and immigration status.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**                | **Essential Plan 1** (EP1)    | **Essential Plan 2** (EP2)  | **Essential Plan 3** (EP3)         | **Essential Plan 4** (EP4) |

| **Primary Care Visit**             | \$15 copay                    | \$0 copay                   | \$0 copay                          | \$0 copay                  |

| **Prescription Drugs**             | \$6 / \$15 / \$30 (Tier1/2/3) | \$1 / \$3 / \$3 (Tier1/2/3) | \$1 / \$3 (Tier1/2)<br>\$3 (Tier3) | \$0 copay all tiers        |

**Coverage:** All Essential Plans cover the **10 Essential Health Benefits** with **no deductibles and low or no copays**. This includes preventative care, doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, labs, maternity, mental health, etc., similar to Qualified Health Plans. **Dental and vision care are included for adults** on all Essential Plans (administered by DentaQuest and EyeMed).

* **EP 1** (income 200% FPL) – \$0 premium, \$0 deductible, modest copays (e.g. \$15 PCP, \$25 specialist, \$75 ER). Individual OOP max \$360/year.
* **EP 2** (income \~150–200% FPL) – \$0 premium, \$0 deductible, *all* services \$0 copay (no cost-sharing). OOP max \$200/year.
* **EP 3** (for certain immigrants <138% FPL) – \$0 premium, \$0 deductible, \$0 copays for medical services. Generic drugs \$1, brands \$3. OOP max \$200.
* **EP 4** (for certain immigrants ≤100% FPL) – \$0 premium, \$0 deductible, **no copays at all** (medical or Rx). OOP max \$200.

**Limits/Exclusions:** Essential Plans cover all standard benefits of commercial plans. There are **no annual or lifetime dollar limits on EHB coverage.** Adult dental includes preventive and basic services; certain complex procedures may have limitations. Non-covered services are generally the same as for marketplace plans (cosmetic surgery, etc.).

**Referrals & Prior Authorization:** EP operates like an HMO – members choose a PCP and generally **need referrals for specialists** (except direct access services). Many services may require prior authorization (e.g., elective surgeries, MRI/CT scans, home health care). Emergency care is covered without prior approval. **Dental and vision services** do not require PCP referral (members can go directly to in-network dentists or eye doctors).

## Child Health Plus (CHP)

**Plan Summary:** *(New York State program for children under 19, regardless of family income)*

| **Benefit/Feature**           | **Child Health Plus** (All Enrollees)        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Deductible**                | \$0                                          |
| **Out-of-Pocket Max**         | \$0 (no cost-sharing for covered services)   |
| **Network Type**              | Managed Care (HMO-style, in-network only)    |
| **Primary Care & Preventive** | \$0 copay (well visits, immunizations, etc.) |
| **Specialist Visit**          | \$0 copay                                    |
| **Emergency Room**            | \$0 copay                                    |
| **Hospital Admission**        | \$0 copay (no per-admission fee)             |
| **Prescription Drugs**        | \$0 copay all tiers (generic & brand)        |

**Coverage:** Child Health Plus provides **comprehensive health coverage for children** with **no copays or deductibles** on covered services. Benefits include **pediatric primary and specialty care, vaccines, emergency care, surgery, hospital stays, mental health services, dental and orthodontic care, vision exams and glasses, hearing services and more**, all at \$0 cost to the family. Prescription drugs for children are covered with no copays as well.

**Limits/Exclusions:** There are generally **no benefit limits** for medically necessary care in CHP. For example, inpatient and outpatient services are covered as needed. Some specific services may have limitations – e.g. hearing aids typically limited to one per year, orthodontics only for severe conditions – but otherwise coverage is broad. CHP does not cover services not medically necessary or experimental treatments.

**Referrals & Prior Authorization:** Children in CHP **have a PCP** who coordinates care. **No referrals are needed for dental or vision specialists** (these are accessed directly). For most specialist visits, the plan may require a PCP referral (consistent with HMO practice). Prior authorization is required for certain high-cost services (such as hospitalizations, certain procedures, some therapies and medical equipment). However, **emergency services are covered without prior approval**. The plan’s care management will pre-arrange needed home care or therapies as appropriate.

## Integrated Dual Eligible & Long-Term Care (Medicaid Advantage Plus)

**Plan Summary:** *(Fully-integrated Medicare-Medicaid plan for dual-eligible individuals who require long-term care services; Healthfirst’s plan in this category is CompleteCare HMO D-SNP.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**           | **CompleteCare (Integrated MAP Plan)**                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deductible (Medicare A/B)** | \$0 (no medical deductible)                                                            |
| **Maximum Out-of-Pocket**     | N/A for Medicaid services (\$0); Medicare \$0 cost-share (Medicaid covers all)         |
| **Network Type**              | HMO – Must use in-network providers for all services                                   |
| **Primary Care & Specialist** | \$0 copay (all physician visits covered in full)                                       |
| **Hospital (Inpatient & ER)** | \$0 copay for hospital stays and ER visits                                             |
| **Long-Term Care Services**   | \$0 copay – includes home care, personal care, adult day care, nursing home care, etc. |
| **Additional Benefits**       | Generous supplemental benefits (see below)                                             |

**Coverage:** The integrated duals plan (CompleteCare) **combines Medicare, Medicaid, and long-term care benefits** into one package. Enrollees have **\$0 cost-sharing for all Medicare-covered services** – doctor visits, specialists, hospitalizations, labs, emergency care, surgeries, etc. (Medicaid pays any Medicare cost-share). **Long-term care services are covered in full** under Medicaid: this includes **personal care/home attendant services, private duty nursing, adult day health care, home-delivered meals, medical transportation, durable medical equipment, and even long-term nursing home placement**. The plan also covers ancillary Medicaid benefits like **dental, vision, and hearing** with no copays. Essentially, **all healthcare needs are covered** under one plan, allowing members to remain in the community with needed supports.

**Additional Benefits:** CompleteCare provides rich supplemental benefits to address member needs. For example, members receive a **monthly OTC Plus card (\$280/month)** for over-the-counter items, healthy foods, and utility payments. There is a **\$0 copay comprehensive dental coverage** (no annual dollar limit noted), **\$0 vision exams and a \$550 yearly allowance for eyeglasses or contacts**, and **\$0 hearing exams with hearing aids covered in full (for standard models)**. The plan also includes **SilverSneakers fitness program access at \$0**, **acupuncture** (up to 60 visits/year total) at \$0, and **unlimited transportation** for medical needs via Medicaid (the plan covers at least 28 one-way rides, and additional rides are covered by Medicaid as needed). After a hospital discharge, members get **meal deliveries (84 meals over 28 days) at no cost**.

**Eligibility Note:** To enroll, members must be **dual-eligible (Medicare + full Medicaid) and certified as requiring a nursing home level of care for >120 days**. They must be able to live safely at home with services.

**Care Management & Prior Authorization:** Each member has an assigned **Care Management Team (with an RN or social worker)** that coordinates all care. **All long-term care services are authorized through the care team**, which develops a personalized plan of care. **Prior authorization is required for virtually all LTSS (long-term services) and many medical services** to ensure they fit the care plan. The care team also coordinates Medicare services (though Medicare acute services themselves may not need plan prior auth, Medicaid will cover any cost-sharing). Emergency and urgently needed services are covered without prior approval, but the care team will follow up to coordinate any additional care.

*(**Note:** This Integrated plan is marketed by Healthfirst as **CompleteCare (HMO D-SNP)**, which is the fully integrated Dual Special Needs Plan.)*

## CompleteCare (HMO D-SNP)

**Plan Summary:** *(Healthfirst CompleteCare is the Medicare Advantage HMO D-SNP that coordinates with Medicaid for integrated coverage – see above. It includes all Medicare Part A, B, D benefits **and** Medicaid long-term care.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**           | **Healthfirst CompleteCare** (D-SNP)                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Medicare Deductible**       | \$0 (none for Part A/B services)                                  |
| **Maximum Out-of-Pocket**     | \$0 member cost-share (Medicaid covers all Medicare costs)        |
| **PCP & Specialist Visits**   | \$0 copay for all visits (no referral needed for in-network care) |
| **Inpatient Hospital**        | \$0 copay (unlimited days)                                        |
| **Skilled Nursing Facility**  | \$0 copay (up to 100 days and beyond)                             |
| **Home Care & LTC Services**  | \$0 copay (personal care, home health, adult day care, etc.)      |
| **Part D Prescription Drugs** | \$0 copay for all tiers (Lis/Extra Help covers drug costs)        |

**Coverage:** CompleteCare covers **everything Original Medicare covers plus additional benefits**, with no copays. All Part A and B services (hospital, primary care, specialists, outpatient, preventive care, etc.) are covered at 100% with no out-of-pocket cost to the member. **Part D prescription drugs** are included with low or \$0 copays (most CompleteCare members qualify for Extra Help/LIS, resulting in \$0 drug copays for generic and brand drugs). The plan also includes the full array of **Medicaid long-term care services**, identical to those listed under the Integrated Duals plan above (home attendants, nursing home care, therapies, transportation, dental, vision, hearing, etc., all at no cost).

**Additional Benefits:** Identical to those described for the Integrated Dual plan – e.g., **\$280/month OTC card, \$0 dental (with no max), \$550 vision allowance, hearing aids, SilverSneakers, acupuncture, meal delivery** – are provided under CompleteCare. These benefits are designed to enhance care for seniors and people with disabilities living at home.

**Prior Authorization:** As a Medicare Advantage plan, CompleteCare **requires prior authorization for many medical services** (e.g., elective inpatient admissions, certain outpatient procedures, high-tech imaging, Part B drugs) just as other Healthfirst Medicare HMO plans do. In addition, **all long-term care and support services are coordinated through care management and require approval** as part of the care plan. The member’s Care Manager serves as a point of contact to arrange services. Emergency services do not require authorization.

*(CompleteCare is essentially the same plan described in the Integrated Dual Eligible & LTC section. It is highlighted separately here as the product name.)*

## Senior Health Partners (Medicaid LTSS Plan – MLTC)

**Plan Summary:** *(Healthfirst Senior Health Partners is a Medicaid Managed Long-Term Care plan for dual-eligibles who have Medicare separately. It covers Medicaid long-term care and ancillary services only.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**         | **Senior Health Partners MLTC**                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deductible/OOP**          | \$0 (no premiums or cost-sharing; Medicaid plan)                                                              |
| **Network Type**            | Managed Long-Term Care (HMO model; in-network providers must be used for services)                            |
| **Primary Medical Care**    | *Not covered by MLTC* (Remains under Medicare/other insurance; SHP coordinates but does not pay these claims) |
| **Long-Term Care Services** | \$0 copay – includes personal care (home attendant), home health nursing, adult day health care, etc.         |
| **Dental, Vision, Hearing** | \$0 copay – covered by the plan as Medicaid benefits                                                          |
| **Nursing Home Care**       | \$0 copay – covers long-term placement if needed (skilled nursing facility care)                              |
| **Transportation**          | \$0 copay – non-emergency medical transportation included (e.g., ambulette to appointments)                   |

**Coverage:** Senior Health Partners (SHP) covers **Medicaid long-term care services and certain supplemental benefits** for members who are dual-eligible. It **does not cover Medicare services** – those (doctor visits, hospitalizations, etc.) are covered by the member’s Medicare plan or Original Medicare. SHP provides the Medicaid services that Medicare doesn’t, allowing members to remain at home. **Covered services include:** a **Care Management Team** to coordinate care, **personal care aide services (home attendants)** for help with activities of daily living, **skilled nursing visits at home, adult day health care programs, home-delivered meals, medical supplies and equipment, personal emergency response systems, physical/occupational/speech therapy, behavioral health supports, podiatry, dentistry, vision care, audiology, and long-term nursing home care** if needed. Essentially, any Community-Based Long Term Care Service (CBLTCS) needed for more than 120 days is covered through this plan.

**Limits:** There are no copays or strict visit limits for covered long-term care services – the amount of services is based on medical necessity and the enrollee’s plan of care. Enrollment requires that a member **needs at least one long-term care service for >120 days** and can safely live in the community with those services. If a member no longer needs LTSS or becomes permanently institutionalized, they may be disenrolled. Dental, vision, and hearing services are covered as part of Medicaid (often for things Medicare may not cover), with appropriate limits (e.g., replacement dentures or eyeglasses per plan rules).

**Care Coordination & Prior Auth:** Each member is assigned a **Primary Care Manager (nurse or social worker)** who coordinates all covered services. **All services under MLTC are authorized through the care management team** – for example, the number of home care hours, approval for a day program, or durable medical equipment must be arranged by the plan. The Care Manager also helps coordinate the member’s Medicare services (though Medicare services are not paid by the MLTC, the team ensures they are aligned with the care plan). There is **no out-of-network coverage**; members must use providers in the MLTC network (e.g., contracted home care agencies, nursing facilities, dental providers). Emergency medical services (hospital/ER) are handled by Medicare, not by this plan.

*(Members who want one integrated plan for Medicare and Medicaid LTSS are often encouraged to join CompleteCare. In fact, the Senior Health Partners info page notes that those who want all benefits in one plan can enroll in CompleteCare for the \$280/month OTC, etc.)*

## Medicare Advantage Plans

Healthfirst offers several Medicare Advantage plans. All include Medicare Parts A and B coverage and Part D prescription drug coverage, along with additional benefits like vision, dental, hearing, and fitness programs. Below is a breakdown of each plan’s key features:

| **Max Out-of-Pocket**  | \$9,350 (annual, in-network Medicare services) *(Note: Medicaid covers cost-sharing, so duals typically pay \$0)*                                                                                      |

| **Extras**             | \$575/quarter OTC + healthy foods card; comprehensive dental \$0; \$350 vision eyewear/year; hearing aids \$0–\$1,475 copay (1 per ear/year); 28 one-way transport/yr \$0; 84 post-discharge meals \$0 |

**Details:** The Life Improvement Plan is a **\$0 premium HMO SNP** for dual-eligibles. **All Medicare-covered services have no copays (\$0)** – doctor visits, specialists, inpatient and outpatient care, mental health, labs, etc. are covered in full. In practice, full-benefit dual members will have **Medicaid pay any Medicare cost-sharing**, so members pay \$0 for services. Part D prescription coverage is included; because members qualify for “Extra Help,” drug copays are low (\$0 to a few dollars) or \$0 if full dual.

**Additional Benefits:** LIP provides very robust supplemental benefits: a high-value **OTC Plus card of \$575 each quarter** (can be used for OTC items, healthy groceries, utility bills, etc.), **comprehensive dental coverage at \$0 copay** (including dentures, extractions, etc.), **vision coverage** (\$0 eye exams + \$350/year for glasses or contacts), and **hearing aids** (\$0 copay for some models, up to \$1,475 copay for advanced model; one aid per ear per year). The plan also gives **\$0 transportation (up to 28 one-way trips/year) to medical appointments** and **meal delivery after hospital discharge (84 meals) at no cost**. *All these extras are aimed at improving health outcomes for dual-eligibles.*

**Prior Authorization:** As an HMO, LIP **requires prior authorization for most non-routine services**. Elective inpatient admissions, skilled nursing facility stays, home health services, specialist procedures, and certain high-cost diagnostics need plan approval. Many supplemental benefits (dental, hearing, etc.) use plan-approved provider networks and may require preauthorization for extensive procedures. Medicaid wraps around to cover Medicare cost-sharing and may also require its own authorization for some services (but from the member perspective, this is handled behind the scenes). Emergency care is always covered without prior auth.

### Connection Plan (CNX) – HMO D-SNP

**Plan Summary:** *(Another Dual-Eligible SNP; similar to LIP but with different benefit emphasis – slightly lower supplemental benefits than LIP.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**    | **Connection Plan HMO D-SNP**                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deductible**         | \$0 (no deductible for medical services)                                                                                                        |
| **Max Out-of-Pocket**  | \$9,350 (in-network) *(Medicaid covers cost-share for duals)*                                                                                   |
| **PCP & Specialist**   | \$0 copay for all PCP and specialist visits                                                                                                     |
| **Hospital / SNF**     | \$0 copay inpatient and \$0 SNF care                                                                                                            |
| **Emergency / Urgent** | \$0 copay ER and urgent care                                                                                                                    |
| **Part D Drugs**       | Low or \$0 copays with Extra Help (same as LIP)                                                                                                 |
| **Extras**             | \$170/quarter OTC card; dental \$0; vision \$350/yr eyewear; hearing aids \$0–\$1,475; 28 one-way transport/yr \$0; 84 meals post-discharge \$0 |

**Details:** The Connection Plan is very similar to the Life Improvement Plan in that **medical services all have \$0 copays for the member**. Dual-eligible individuals will not be charged for covered services; any Medicare cost-sharing is picked up by Medicaid. The **Medicare MOOP is \$9,350** but in practice members rarely reach this since Medicaid covers the costs. Part D coverage is included with full Extra Help, so drug costs are minimal.

**Differences from LIP:** The Connection Plan offers a **smaller OTC allowance (\$170 per quarter)** than LIP and potentially slightly different network or eligibility focus. All the core supplemental benefits are present (comprehensive \$0 dental, \$350 vision, hearing aids coverage, transportation, meals) just like LIP. In essence, CNX provides the same **\$0 cost medical coverage** to duals but with a more modest OTC benefit. (This plan might target partial duals or those who don’t qualify for full Medicaid, but Healthfirst’s criteria still require at least Medicaid cost-share eligibility.)

**Prior Authorization:** Connection Plan is also an HMO SNP, so **prior authorization rules are the same as LIP**. Members will need plan approval for certain specialist services, hospital stays, advanced treatments, etc. The plan coordinates with Medicaid to ensure services are covered appropriately. As always, emergencies are covered without prior approval.

### Increased Benefit Plan (IBP) – HMO (Extra Help/LIS)

**Plan Summary:** *(A Medicare Advantage plan for individuals who are eligible for Low-Income Subsidy (“Extra Help”) on Part D but may not have full Medicaid. It offers richer benefits than standard MA plans to complement the LIS.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**     | **Increased Benefits Plan HMO**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Inpatient Hospital**  | \$440 copay per day (days 1–5), \$0 after day 5                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Skilled Nursing**     | \$0/day days 1–20; \$214/day days 21–100                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Part D Prescription** | Included – **\$0 deductible;** standard LIS copays (e.g., \$0–\$4 for generics, \$0–\$9 for brands with Extra Help)                                                                                       |
| **Extras**              | \$110/quarter OTC card (for LIS members); Dental \$0 (no annual max); Vision \$0 exams + \$250 eyewear/yr; Hearing \$0 exams + aids \$0–\$1,475; 40 one-way transport/yr \$0; 84 post-discharge meals \$0 |

**Details:** The Increased Benefit Plan is a \$0 premium HMO designed for Medicare beneficiaries who aren’t dual-eligible for Medicaid but do qualify for some level of **Extra Help on prescription drugs**. The plan **lowers typical Medicare copays** to make care more affordable. For example, **primary care visits are \$0** and specialists \$20, which is lower than many standard plans. Many preventive services are \$0 (annual exam, etc.). Hospital inpatient stays have a cost-share (\$440 per day for days 1–5) but no cost after day 5, and **skilled nursing facility care is \$0 for the first 20 days** (then a copay for days 21–100, matching Medicare’s cost-sharing). The MOOP is \$9,350, providing catastrophic protection.

Importantly, Part D drug coverage in IBP has **no deductible** and utilizes the member’s LIS subsidy – typically **Tier 1 generics \$0, Tier 2 generics \~\$1–\$3, brand drugs \~\$4–\$9** with full Extra Help, and no coverage gap. This means prescriptions are very low-cost for members.

**Additional Benefits:** This plan includes several extras: a **\$110 quarterly OTC allowance** (available to those with LIS), **comprehensive dental at \$0 copay** (no annual dollar limit), **vision coverage** (\$0 routine eye exams + \$250 toward glasses/contacts each year), **hearing coverage** (\$0 exams and hearing aids with \$0–\$1,475 copay per aid), **transportation** (up to 40 one-way trips to doctors/pharmacies per year), and **post-hospital meal deliveries** (84 meals after discharge). These benefits “increase” what one would normally get, aligning with the plan’s name.

**Prior Authorization:** As with other Healthfirst HMO plans, **IBP requires prior authorization for certain services**: e.g., scheduled hospital admissions, some outpatient surgeries, specialist services like physical therapy beyond a certain number of visits, and high-tech imaging or Part B medications. Referrals from a PCP may be needed to see specialists within the network. The plan uses a network of providers exclusively (no out-of-network coverage, except emergencies). Members should ensure major services are pre-approved to avoid denial. Emergency services worldwide are covered with the listed ER copay, without prior approval.

### 65 Plus Plan – HMO

**Plan Summary:** *(A Medicare Advantage plan geared for seniors (65+) with Medicare only – a classic HMO with moderate cost-sharing.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**      | **65+ Plan HMO (Healthfirst)**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Part D Rx Deductible** | \$0 (no deductible), standard copays (tiers 1–5) – e.g. \$0 Tier1, \$15 Tier2, \$47 Tier3, 50% Tier4, 25% Tier5                                                                                          |
| **Extras**               | \$85/quarter Choice OTC card or 30 transport trips (member’s choice); Dental \$0 (up to \$2,500/yr); Vision \$0 exam + \$200 eyewear/yr; Hearing \$0 exam + aids \$0–\$1,475; SilverSneakers fitness \$0 |

**Details:** The 65 Plus Plan is a standard Medicare Advantage HMO with **low copays for routine services**. **Primary care visits are \$0** and specialists are \$25, making it affordable to see doctors. The hospital inpatient copay structure is \$460 per day for the first 5 days, then no charge beyond that. An inpatient stay of, say, 3 days would cost \$1,380; a longer 7-day stay would cost \$2,300 (5×\$460). Skilled Nursing Facility care after a hospital stay has the Medicare-standard \$0 for days 1–20, then \$214/day for days 21–100 if needed. Emergency room visits cost \$110 (waived if admitted), and urgent care \$45. There is **no medical deductible and no lifetime max** – coverage is unlimited with those copays. The annual MOOP \$9,350 provides financial protection if someone has many copays in a year.

Part D prescription coverage is included with **\$0 deductible**. Typical copays in 2025 for a non-LIS member on this plan are: Tier 1 preferred generics \$0, Tier 2 generics \~\$15, Tier 3 preferred brands \~\$47, Tier 4 non-preferred 50% coinsurance, Tier 5 specialty 25% coinsurance. Insulins are capped at \$35/month by regulation.

**Additional Benefits:** The 65+ Plan offers a **“Choice Extra”** benefit: upon enrollment, members choose either an **OTC card of \$85 each quarter** *or* a **transportation benefit of 30 one-way trips per quarter** for non-emergency medical needs. (They cannot change this choice until the next year.) The plan includes **preventive dental and comprehensive dental at \$0 copay, up to \$2,000 per year** in dental services coverage. Vision benefit: **\$0 routine eye exams and \$200 allowance annually for glasses or contacts**. Hearing: **\$0 routine hearing exams and hearing aids with copay \$0–\$1,475** per aid (same hearing hardware benefit as other plans). A fitness membership through SilverSneakers is included at no cost. These extras make the plan attractive for those who want dental/vision coverage beyond Original Medicare.

**Prior Authorization:** 65+ Plan being an HMO means members **must use Healthfirst’s provider network and obtain referrals/authorizations as required.** Generally, a member will need prior authorization for hospital admissions, certain outpatient surgeries, home health care, durable medical equipment, and other substantial services. Many routine services (office visits, basic radiology, etc.) do not require pre-approval but may require a referral from the PCP to a specialist. **No out-of-network coverage** is provided except emergencies or urgently needed care out of area (covered at in-network cost). The plan’s Evidence of Coverage details which services need advance approval. Members should work with their PCP and the plan for any planned procedures to ensure compliance.

| **Urgent Care**          | \$45 copay                                                                                 | \$45 copay (same cost out-of-network urgent)                  |

| **Part D Rx Deductible** | \$590 (applies to Tier 4–5 drugs) – Tiers 1–3 no deductible; standard copays for all tiers | *Same as in-network (Part D coverage is not network-limited)* |

**Details:** The Signature PPO provides more freedom to see providers. Members can go **out-of-network for covered services, but pay a higher cost-share**. There is *no referral needed* to see specialists even in-network. The in-network cost-sharing is moderate: e.g., \$35 specialist copay, \$325/day inpatient for 5 days max. Out-of-network, the member typically pays a percentage: 40% of the cost for hospital stays, 50% for skilled nursing, 30% for outpatient surgeries, etc. Office visits out-of-network have fixed copays (\$50 primary, \$60 specialist). The plan’s **combined in/out-of-network out-of-pocket maximum is \$8,000**; if the member hits this, the plan covers 100% thereafter. In-network alone has a \$5,000 MOOP for those staying in network.

Emergency and urgent care are covered at the same copay whether in or out of network (since ER/urgent situations may happen anywhere). Notably, **Signature PPO covers out-of-network Medicare providers nationwide, as long as they accept Medicare**; members just have higher cost-share out-of-network.

Prescription drug coverage is included. The **Part D deductible is \$590 (for Tier 4 and 5 drugs only)**. Tier 1 generics have \$0 copay, Tier 2 \$15, Tier 3 \$47 (30- or 90-day same copay) with no deductible. After the deductible, Tier 4 drugs are 50% coinsurance and Tier 5 specialty 25% coinsurance. Insulins are capped at \$35 per month by regulation.

**Additional Benefits:** Signature PPO comes with a **\$725 annual Flex Card** that members can use toward dental, vision, or hearing expenses or certain wellness items. The plan includes a **dental benefit**: \$0 copay for preventive and comprehensive dental in-network, with the plan paying up to \$1,500/year total (combined in/out). Out-of-network dental is covered with copays (\$20 for preventive visit, \$100 for major services) up to that \$1,500 limit. **Vision benefit:** \$0 routine exam and \$250 yearly allowance for eyewear. **Hearing:** \$0 routine exam and hearing aids with \$0–\$1,475 copay each (one per ear/year). The plan also offers **nutrition counseling** (6 visits/year at \$0 in-network), **acupuncture** (20 visits/year for chronic low back pain + 12 additional for other conditions at \$0 in-network), **Teladoc telemedicine** (\$0) and 24/7 Nurse Hotline (\$0). Post-discharge meal benefit is included (84 meals). **Worldwide emergency coverage** is included (ER copay \$125).

**Prior Authorization:** Signature PPO **does not require referrals**, but **prior authorization is still required for certain procedures/services**. In-network providers will handle obtaining plan auth for things like hospital admissions, some outpatient procedures, home health, or high-cost diagnostics. If a member goes out-of-network, it’s strongly recommended they or their provider seek pre-certification from Healthfirst for any planned inpatient stay or major service, to confirm medical necessity and coverage. Out-of-network providers may not do this automatically, so members have to be proactive (the plan provides a guide for out-of-network providers on obtaining auth). Emergency services never require prior authorization. The PPO gives flexibility, but using in-network providers is more cost-effective for the member.

### Signature Plan – HMO (Healthfirst Signature HMO)

**Plan Summary:** *(Healthfirst’s Signature HMO is similar in benefit design to the PPO but requires using the HMO network. It often has lower out-of-pocket costs in exchange for no out-of-network coverage.)*

| **Benefit/Feature**      | **Signature HMO (Healthfirst)**                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Deductible**           | \$0 (no medical deductible)                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Max Out-of-Pocket**    | \$6,700 in-network                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Primary Care Visit**   | \$0 copay                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Specialist Visit**     | \$30 copay                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Emergency Room**       | \$125 copay (waived if admitted)                                                                                                                                               |
| **Urgent Care**          | \$55 copay                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Inpatient Hospital**   | \$430 copay per day (days 1–5), \$0 after day 5                                                                                                                                |
| **Skilled Nursing**      | \$10/day days 1–20; \$214/day days 21–100                                                                                                                                      |
| **Part D Rx Deductible** | \$0 (no ded); copays similar to PPO (e.g., \$0 Tier1, \$15 Tier2, \$47 Tier3)                                                                                                  |
| **Extras**               | Choice Benefit: **\$85/quarter OTC card OR 30 rides/quarter**; Dental \$0 (up to \$2,500/yr); Vision \$0 + \$250 eyewear; Hearing \$0 + aids \$0–\$1,475; SilverSneakers, etc. |

**Details:** The Signature HMO requires staying in the Healthfirst network (except emergencies) but in return offers slightly lower out-of-pocket exposure than the PPO. The annual MOOP is **\$6,700** (vs \$8,000 combined on PPO). Many copays mirror those of the PPO’s in-network rates: \$0 PCP, \$30 specialist, \$430/day for 5 days inpatient, \$125 ER, etc. One difference: the specialist copay is \$30 (HMO) vs \$35 (PPO in-network) – slightly cheaper. The plan has *no out-of-network coverage* (except emergencies). Part D coverage is the same structure: no deductible, set copays for tiers (the formulary is identical to PPO).

**Additional Benefits:** The Signature HMO includes a **“Choice Extra”** option identical to 65+ Plan: the member chooses either **quarterly OTC allowance (\$85) or transportation (30 one-way trips per quarter)** as an added benefit. It also has a higher **annual dental allowance of \$2,500** for comprehensive services at \$0 copay in-network. Vision is \$250/year for eyewear at \$0 exam. Hearing benefit is the same (\$0 exams, hearing aids with capped copay). Essentially, the supplemental benefits mirror the PPO, except instead of a flex card, the HMO uses the OTC/transportation choice model. Fitness membership (SilverSneakers) is included, and other perks like nutrition counseling (6 visits) and acupuncture (20+12 visits) are at \$0 cost as well.

**Prior Authorization:** Signature HMO functions like a typical Medicare HMO. **Prior authorizations are needed for high-cost services, specialist procedures, hospital stays, etc.**, and members **must use in-network providers.** A PCP referral may be required for some specialist visits (the plan materials mention the PCP coordinates care, though explicit referral rules can vary – usually HMO plans encourage but may not mandate referrals for each specialist). Members should confirm with Customer Service if specialist referral is needed. All elective inpatient admissions, certain outpatient surgeries, home health care, Part B injectable drugs, and durable equipment will need plan approval in advance. The care management team and utilization review ensure services are medically necessary. As always, emergencies are covered worldwide without prior approval (ER copay applies).

## Marketplace Plans (Individual & Family “Leaf” Plans)

Healthfirst’s Marketplace plans are Qualified Health Plans for individuals and families, offered in metallic tiers: **Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Catastrophic (Green Leaf)**. These are sold as **Healthfirst Leaf Plans** (standard network) and **Leaf Premier Plans** (with adult dental/vision included). All plans cover the **10 Essential Health Benefits** (EHB) such as preventive care, doctor visits, hospitalizations, prescriptions, maternity, mental health, etc. Below is a summary of each metal level plan:

### Platinum Leaf & Platinum Leaf Premier

**Plan Summary:** *Highest premium, lowest cost-sharing.*

* **Deductible:** \$0 individual / \$0 family for both Platinum Leaf and Premier.
* **Out-of-Pocket Max:** \$2,000 individual / \$4,000 family – very low, meaning the plan pays 90%+ of costs.
* **Primary Care:** \$15 copay (Leaf) vs **\$10 copay (Premier)**.
* **Specialist:** \$35 copay (Leaf) vs \$40 copay (Premier).
* **Emergency Room:** \$100 copay (both).
* **Hospital Inpatient:** \$500 copay per admission (both).
* **Network Type:** HMO/EPO – must use in-network providers; no out-of-network coverage except emergencies.
* **Notable:** Platinum **Leaf Premier includes adult dental and vision** benefits with small copays (Leaf standard does not cover adult dental/vision). For example, Premier has a \$10 copay for adult dental cleanings and adult vision exams, whereas standard Leaf has no coverage for those services. Pediatric dental/vision are covered on all plans (e.g., \$15 copay pediatric dental on Leaf vs \$10 on Premier).

**Additional Details:** With no deductible and low copays, Platinum plans offer very minimal out-of-pocket expense. Virtually all services (PCP, specialists, labs, X-rays, urgent care, prescription drugs) have fixed copays. **Prescription coverage:** Typically \$10 generic, \$30 brand on Leaf; Premier had \$5 generic, \$50 brand in 2024 – indicating Premier may have slightly different drug copays (favoring generic tier). All preventive care is \$0 as mandated.

**Prior Authorization:** Required for certain high-cost services (hospitalizations, some specialists, elective procedures) as per any HMO/EPO plan. PCP referrals are generally required to see specialists under these plans (except OB/GYN and other direct-access per state rules).

### Gold Leaf, Gold Leaf Premier (& Premier Plus)

**Plan Summary:** *Lower premium than Platinum, moderate cost-sharing.*

* **Deductible:** \$600 individual / \$1,200 family for Gold Leaf. Gold Leaf Premier also had a \$0 medical deductible in 2024 for many services (with slightly different cost structure).
* **Out-of-Pocket Max:** \$7,900 individual / \$15,800 family for standard Gold (approximately the ACA max). Premier/Premier Plus variants may have slightly different OOP limits.
* **Primary Care:** Gold Leaf \~\$25 copay **after deductible**. **Gold Leaf Premier:** \~\$20 copay not subject to deductible. *(Premier Plus variant in 2024 offered first PCP/specialist visit each year with no deductible)*.
* **Specialist:** Gold Leaf \$25 copay after ded; Gold Premier \$20 copay (some visits might not require ded).
* **Emergency Room:** \$150 copay after deductible (Leaf); Premier \$175 after ded; Premier Plus \$250 after ded.
* **Hospital Inpatient:** Typically 20% coinsurance or a per admission fee. (Gold Leaf on Healthfirst likely uses a mix of copays/coinsurance for inpatient services.)
* **Network Type:** HMO/EPO (no out-of-network).

**Differences in Premier:** Gold **Premier** includes adult dental/vision (like Platinum Premier) – e.g., \$10 copay adult dental cleaning/vision exam. Premier also tends to have *slightly lower PCP copays but slightly higher specialist or ER copays* compared to base Leaf. **Premier Plus** (if offered) further tweaks cost-sharing (often allowing one no-deductible visit). These plan variations are designed to give consumers options with or without adult dental/vision.

**Example:** In 2024, **Gold Leaf Premier Plus** allowed the first visit to certain outpatient providers (PCP, specialist, mental health, etc.) without applying the deductible, then subsequent visits had copays after deductible. This is an enhanced feature for that variant.

**Prior Authorization:** Same rules as other marketplace plans – certain services (e.g., elective surgeries, CT/MRI scans, physical therapy beyond certain visits, etc.) need pre-approval. No specialist visit coverage without referral (depending on plan rules; Healthfirst typically requires PCP referral for specialists in individual plans).

### Silver Leaf & Silver Leaf Premier

**Plan Summary:** *Mid-range premium and cost-sharing. Silver plans also have variants with Cost-Sharing Reductions (CSR) if eligible through NY State of Health.*

* **Deductible:** Varies by income/CSR level. For standard Silver ( >250% FPL): often around \$2,000–\$4,000 individual. For CSR Silver 73, 87, 94 variants: deductibles can be \$1,000, \$600, or \$0 respectively. (For example, Silver Leaf at 150–200% FPL had \$0 deductible; at 200–250% FPL a small deductible; standard >250% FPL had higher deductible.)
* **Out-of-Pocket Max:** Also varies. Ranges from as low as \~\$1,075 individual (Silver CSR 94) up to \~\$9,200 (standard Silver). Family OOP max double those amounts.
* **Primary Care:** Could be \$30–\$40 copay after deductible (standard Silver). Under CSR variants, PCP could be \$0 or \$15 depending on level.
* **Specialist:** Standard Silver might be \~\$50-\$75 after ded. CSR versions lower (possibly \$0–\$25).
* **Emergency Room:** Typically \$300 copay after deductible for standard Silver; lower for CSR (EP4 equivalent Silver had \$0 ER, but that’s essentially Essential Plan).
* **Hospital Inpatient:** Often coinsurance (e.g., 20% after deductible) on Silver plans or a copay per day. For instance, Healthfirst’s Silver likely uses a coinsurance model: e.g., 20% after ded for inpatient facility.
* **Network Type:** HMO/EPO in-network only.

**Important:** Silver plans for low-income enrollees are **Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR)** variants in NY. Healthfirst labels these by FPL ranges on their SBCs. **Silver Leaf Premier** includes adult dental/vision like other Premier plans (with small copays for those services), whereas base Silver does not.

**CSR Example:** A Silver Leaf plan for 100–150% FPL effectively becomes like Platinum: \$0 deductible, \$0 OOP max \~\$1,000, \$0 copays on most services (this is essentially Essential Plan 2, which is outside marketplace but analogous). For 150–200% FPL (CSR 87), maybe a \$500 ded and \$2,450 OOP max with low copays. For 200–250% (CSR 73), moderate deductible and OOP max \~\$6,100 individual. Standard Silver >250%, highest deductible/OOP of Silver tier.

Healthfirst’s **Silver Premier** options mirror these but add adult dental/vision coverage and possibly slightly adjusted copays (similar strategy as Gold/Platinum Premier differences).

**Prior Authorization:** Consistent across all marketplace tiers – prior approval needed for many hospital services, advanced procedures, certain medications. Silver plan members with higher cost-sharing should be particularly encouraged to get approvals and use in-network providers to avoid unexpected bills. PCP referrals to specialists are generally required.

### Bronze Leaf & Bronze Leaf Premier

**Plan Summary:** *Low premium, high cost-sharing.*

* **Deductible:** High – often close to the out-of-pocket max. For example, Bronze Leaf individual deductible around \$7,000–\$9,000. Family deductible double.
* **Out-of-Pocket Max:** \~\$9,200 individual / \$18,400 family (near the ACA limit).
* **Primary Care:** Subject to deductible on standard Bronze. Typically, Bronze plans require you to pay full cost of most services until the deductible is met. However, **3 primary care visits per year are exempt from the deductible** by law for Bronze plans – you might pay a copay (\~\$50) for those first 3 visits even if ded not met.
* **Specialist:** After deductible, copays or coinsurance apply (e.g., \$ specialist copay or \~50% coinsurance). If one of the 3 allowed pre-ded visits is used for a specialist (sometimes plans allow this), then just the copay applies.
* **Emergency Room:** Often a copay \~\$350-\$500 after deductible on Bronze.
* **Hospital Inpatient:** Typically 50% coinsurance after deductible on Bronze plans.
* **Network Type:** HMO/EPO.

**Bronze Premier:** If offered, would add adult dental/vision. The core medical cost-sharing remains the same high deductible model (adult dental/vision would likely not be subject to the big deductible though – usually those have separate small cost-shares).

**Catastrophic “Green Leaf” Plan:** For individuals under 30 (or hardship exemption) – *very low premium, very high deductible.* The **Green Leaf plan has a deductible equal to the out-of-pocket max** (around \$9,200). **Essentially all non-preventive services apply to the deductible.** Preventive care is free, and by law the plan also allows **3 primary care visits per year at a standard copay (e.g., \$0 or \$ office visit)** before deductible. After the deductible is met, the plan pays 100%. This plan is intended as safety-net coverage; it has the lowest premium but highest potential costs if care is needed.

**Coverage:** All these plans (Bronze and Catastrophic) still cover all essential benefits – hospital, surgery, maternity, prescriptions, etc. However, because of the high deductibles, the member pays most costs out-of-pocket until that deductible is reached. For Bronze, once the deductible is reached, typically coinsurance kicks in (e.g., 50% the plan/50% member until OOP max). For Catastrophic, once the deductible/OOP max is reached, the plan pays 100%.

**Prior Authorization:** Absolutely required for major services – especially on Bronze/Catastrophic, since improper out-of-network use or lack of authorization could leave a member responsible for huge costs. These plans require using in-network providers only. PCP referrals likely required for specialists (to ensure care is coordinated). Even though many Bronze users won’t hit their deductible, they must follow plan rules for coverage.

**Adult Dental & Vision:** Only included if the plan is a “Premier” version. If Bronze Leaf Premier is available, it would cover adult dental/vision with modest copays, which do *not* apply to the massive medical deductible (these benefits usually kick in immediately). Without Premier, adult dental/vision are not covered (except pediatric).

## Small-Group EPO Plans (Healthfirst Pro EPO Plans)

Healthfirst’s small employer plans (offered to businesses) are **Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)** plans. They come in metal tiers **Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze**, often branded as **“Pro” EPO plans**. These plans utilize an expanded provider network (including major hospital systems like Northwell, Mount Sinai, Montefiore, etc.) for small group members. *No out-of-network coverage is provided,* except emergencies, meaning members must use network providers.

**Key Features by Tier:**

* **Platinum Pro EPO:** *Very low cost-sharing.* Deductible is often \$0 for single coverage. Copays are small (e.g., PCP \$10, Specialist \$20). Out-of-pocket max might be around \$4,000 individual. This plan covers 90% of costs on average. Ideal for groups wanting rich benefits similar to Medicaid/Essential Plan levels of coverage.
* **Gold Pro EPO:** *Moderate cost-sharing.* For example, a common design is around a \$1,000–\$1,500 individual deductible. OOP max around \$8,150 (close to ACA max for small group). Copays: PCP \~\$25-\$30, Specialist \$50, Emergency \$300, Hospital inpatient 20% coinsurance or a copay per day. This plan is \~80% actuarial value.
* **Silver Pro EPO:** *Higher cost-sharing.* Deductibles could be in the \$3,000–\$5,000 range individual. Out-of-pocket max perhaps \~\$8,700 (ACA max). After deductible, members might pay 20% coinsurance or set copays. Example: Silver might have a \$3,000 ded and then 20% coinsurance on most services, or \$50 PCP/\$100 specialist after ded. These plans (70% AV) shift more cost to employees while keeping premiums lower for the employer.
* **Bronze Pro EPO:** *Very high cost-sharing.* Deductibles typically \$7,000+ (often matching the OOP max). Employees pay almost all costs until the deductible is met. After that, coinsurance \~50% may apply. Preventive care is free, and sometimes a few doctor visits may have a copay pre-deductible. This plan (\~60% AV) is chosen for lowest premiums.

**Adult Dental and Vision:** Small group plans can be offered with or without adult dental/vision. Healthfirst’s **“Pro Plus” EPO plans include adult dental and vision coverage**, whereas standard “Pro” plans do not. For example, a **Gold Pro Plus** EPO would cover routine adult dental cleanings, fillings, etc., and vision exams/glasses with small copays, whereas Gold Pro EPO would exclude those services. Employers choose whether to buy the version with dental/vision. Pediatric dental/vision are included in all plans as required.

**Prior Authorization & Referrals:** The small group EPOs follow similar rules as the individual plans. They are managed by Healthfirst Insurance Company, so **prior authorization is required for certain services** (e.g., hospital admissions, advanced imaging, select specialists procedures). EPO means no referrals needed to see in-network specialists – employees can directly schedule with any network specialist (like a PPO, but limited to network). However, using a primary care doctor as a coordinator is encouraged. There is **no coverage outside the network**, so members should always use Healthfirst contracted providers/facilities. Emergency care is covered at any hospital (in or out of network) at the in-network cost-sharing.

**Summary of Cost-Sharing:** While exact figures vary by plan design, below is a representative snapshot for **Small Group EPO plans**:

* **Platinum Pro EPO:** \$0 ded; OOP max \~\$4,000. Copays: \$20 PCP, \$40 Specialist, \$100 ER, \$250/admission.

*(The above are illustrative; actual employer plan designs may differ slightly. All adhere to ACA requirements for coverage and maximum out-of-pocket limits.)*

**Network:** Healthfirst small group network is broader than the individual network, as noted. Members should verify their providers in the “Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze Pro EPO” network when seeking care.

**Prior Authorization:** Required for similar services as individual plans – inpatient care, certain outpatient procedures, rehab admissions, some high-cost drugs. Since these are EPOs, the plan must pre-approve out-of-network treatment if ever needed (e.g., a rare specialty service not available in network) or it won’t be covered.

**Conclusion:** Small group EPO plans are used by employers to cover their employees with a range of cost-sharing options. They have **no out-of-network benefits (except emergency)**, so employees should stay in network. They feature **lower premiums at Bronze/Silver with high deductibles**, and **higher premiums at Gold/Platinum with very low out-of-pocket costs**. Employers may add riders (like Pro Plus for dental/vision) to enhance benefits. Call center agents should verify the specific plan design (by looking up the group’s SBC) when assisting members, as exact copays can vary by employer plan.
