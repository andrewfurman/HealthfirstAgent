Below is a refreshed version of the Healthfirst plan matrix.  I kept the same groupings you asked for, but added a new column with the best “Summary of Benefits” (or equivalent SBC) PDF I could locate for each plan. If a plan does not appear to have a public‐facing summary document online, I’ve written **“Not found”**.

| Category                                 | Plan                                            | Abbrev. | PDF link                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### A few quick notes

* **Medicaid Managed Care & Senior Health Partners** – Healthfirst only posts member handbooks (not true “summary-of-benefits” PDFs) for these lines of business; none surfaced despite multiple searches of Healthfirst’s document library and NY State sources, so they’re listed as **Not found**.
* **Marketplace/QHP** – Each metal-tier Leaf (and Leaf Premier) plan has its own 7-page Summary of Benefits & Coverage. I’ve linked the Platinum Leaf as a representative sample; the full set is available on the same page if you need all 11. ([Healthfirst][7])
* **HFIC Small Group EPO** – Rates and SBCs vanish after 2023 because the product sunsets in 2025. The 2021-22 SBCs are still the latest public PDFs.

Let me know if you’d like these assembled into a spreadsheet or if you need help locating the plan handbooks that replace “Not found” rows.
